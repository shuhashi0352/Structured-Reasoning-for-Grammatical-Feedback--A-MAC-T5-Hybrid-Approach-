The sentence \"I really like spending time with my great grandmother I really love her I think it's one of the most valuable persons in my life\" is a run-on sentence with multiple ideas crammed together without clear connections.\n\n3. The reason this is wrong is that it makes the sentence hard to follow and understand. In English, it's important to clearly connect related ideas and avoid unnecessary repetition. This helps make your statement more coherent and easy to understand. Run-on sentences, like the one in the original text, break this rule by cramming multiple ideas together without clear connections or transitions.\n\n4. The sentence is corrected by restructuring it to connect the ideas more clearly and eliminate unnecessary repetition. The corrected sentence is \"I really love her I think she's one of the most important people in my life she's taught me so much and I really enjoy spending time with her\".

This is incorrect because in English, when we want to show ownership or possession, we use the possessive form. This is usually done by adding an apostrophe and 's' to the end of the noun. In this case, the online programs belong to the master's degree, so we need to use the possessive form \"master's\".\n\n4. The corrected sentence therefore reads: \"I don't agree with this because for example there are a lot of degrees and master's online and in my opinion, I think that they are a good option to study\".

Simply saying \"go\" can be ambiguous and might not clearly convey the intended meaning. \n\n4. The sentence is corrected by adding the word \"out\" after \"go\".

This is incorrect because 'advice' is a mass noun in English. Mass nouns, also known as uncountable nouns, cannot be counted directly. Therefore, we cannot say 'one advice'. Instead, when we want to refer to a single instance or example of something that is usually uncountable, we use the phrase 'piece of'. \n\n4. The correction is to replace \"one advice\" with \"one piece of advice\".
