well to be honest i 'm not a big fan of environment but however i am still care about the environment and trees and animals
i suppose to be similar to my sister because she is near my age and we have some very related topics like we both enjoy playing games and computers
my whole life i 've been living in damascus syria but in the future i 'm planning to get the nationality in canada and i 'm also planning to reside there for the rest of my life
having the fitness classes is a very critical thing students should keep their health and wellness in its best part because they are in the best age of health and they have to focus on that age to do many sports and to do other workouts actually on the other hand it has some disadvantages for example you know it might take their time you know schools does n't have that amount of time my opinion is definitely to do fitness classes inside the school
hello everyone in today 's presentation we are going to talk about honey and how it 's produced so we are going to tell you how it 's going from flower to your hand and how it 's produced first bees collect the nectar from flowers then they return to the beehives and make the honey using the nectar when they are finished beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives then those honey are stored in the glasses when they are stored they are shipped to the shops and supermarkets this is the journey of the honey i hope you enjoy it
there 's no doubt that choosing a country is essential thing for students in order to decide in which university they want to study so the first they should consider the safety of the country and the education equality
there is no doubt that the students who want study abroad would face many difficulties
students has many other options in order to learn about the local country and the local culture in my opinion they can go and participate in social events
what we enjoy the most is playing video games
i am most similar to my father i have not only in a physical way but in a intellectual way we have similar ways of thought and of think
i would like to live in a city the cities i like the most are london paris and here in spain i would like to live in madrid or in barcelona i do n't care
and i think that school and college should make time in the school to practice some exercises and to promote a more fitness lifestyle because it can help to fight both physical and mental health and at the same time the disadvantage of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as a study time or learning some other things
honey is collected from bees
i think that when a student is chosen a country to go to study there the first thing that they are thinking about is about the university quality
i think that the best thing of studying in a second language is that you can put in in your resume and at the same time it is a very valuable thing that enterprises value
i think that there are a lot of constraints when you 're studying in another country first of all you have to learn a new language and talk in a new language or in your second language
i think that students can learn from local culture going with their classmates and learning from them asking them
in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything at your own for example you have to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you do n't do when you live alone
is too cold in winter and too hot in summer
in holiday i like to enjoy my time because is a break i like to travel go to the beach and sometimes i stay at home watching movies
i like spend time with all my family with my brothers with my sister with my parents and also with my cousins
in the future i would like to work in a company called johnson and johnson and i would like the position of the engineer senior in the area of the develop new products
in my opinion is a good idea that students in get a job to pay their studies but you had to haved of a job of the half time because you have to get a balance between your students and your job one of the advantage is that you can get experience because a lot of students get graduate but they have not idea about how is the laboral world in my opinion is one of the best thing that one student can do when they are studying yet
the next picture shows the stages people need to good through when they go to travel by airplane first all you have to get the airport and make your check in after that you have to go to document control
technology offer us a lot of tools to improve our way to learn one of them is that we can look for all the information using internet as we can look for examples in videos
face to face is the best way to learn because you can look your professor and you can concentrate best in this way you have not distractors
the group projects give us the opportunity to learn to work in teams to use all the abilities of each one of the members in a team
attending lectures by yourself in my opinion it 's best because you can pause when you need instead when you are attending lectures with other people you can not do that
for example in my own experience i learn best when i am listening
is to one hour to barcelona to half an hour to the beach it 's a nice place
in holiday i enjoy staying with friends and going to the mountains sometimes to the beach
in my close family maybe with my mother in my second close family maybe with my brother in law
i am not sure but one possibility of job is as a teacher is one of my favorite jobs now
i think that one advantage is that while you are working you are learning what is the life and the same time you are studying of course and the disadvantage is that maybe you are too much busy working and studying at the same time than you can turn a little stressed and this is n't a good thing for the healthy and in my opinion i think that is a good idea do the both things at the same time working and studying because working you can learn a lot of things that you ca n't learn studying and studying you can learn things that you ca n't learn while working
for to travelling by airplane first you must arrive to the airport by car by train or by coach then when you are here you must check in after check in you must pass the document control where you need your passport after the security control you must wait for the boarding moment then while you can take some lunch or coffee when you are boarding after you board you can fly to your destination
i think that the technology can improve the study because you can find faster in the information and at the same time you can stay in connecting with other bit of people
me too i think the same i think that the face to face you are more interested with the person with them
with group projects the people can improve develop the patience the quiet listening and thinking more deep and the communication more efficient
in my case i think that it 's better reading alone because i prefer the silent and the quietness and the calm
it 's important because not all the people have the possibility to have the all facilities
that really matters to me to inform myself about what is happening in the world i think that 's really important to be aware of yeah what 's happening around to me so i really enjoy listening to radio in the morning
what i preferred when i was a child was playing with little cars and imagine a kind of city with homes buildings schools and i was a creative kid i think
i really hope to have the opportunity to live abroad coz i think it 's an incredible human experience for instance i 'd like to go to america on the west coast in a city like san francisco and just enjoying
and actually i do n't see lot of disadvantages there are not drawback
but the tunes net it was the worst at the first day and after five days we can observe like an incredible increase of the visits on the website comparing to the yellow site which would be the totally opposite it just fell up
there are able to understand their needs and their problem they communicate a lot with their peer
i think the main issue that you have so much work to do everything and plus i think i am deeply convince that having a small team can create anxiousty and problems
you just have to really communicate explain what you do
i 'm deeply convinced that you can do a better work if you share your opinion and your ideas with coworkers but i 'm not sure that people working alone are bad at work
i enjoy because i enjoy travelling so the best way to to going travelling is knowing about the other cultures
i enjoy hiking reading studying and spending time with my family and well my free time i try to enjoy a lot so a lot of hobbies i have and work out
obviously the best way to improve my english is travelling abroad to countries where they speak english but it 's impossible to travel the whole year so studying
i 'm going to speak about if all students university students should do part time jobs while they are studying which are the main advantage the main advantage is obviously they can get money to pay their studies a part time job give more independence and allows to be in contact with real job however one of the disadvantage is they have less free time to study
the pollution caused by factories and vehicles rise to the air and are carried by winds
the advice i would give is to eat mostly fruit and fresh vegetables and give up fast food and fat food that can damage our health
i think is better to sleep eight hour however sometime is impossible to do it because our busy style life does n't allowed to sleep eight hours
technology can have a positive or negatives effects
i am very interested in learning about other countries and personally i did study abroad in ireland and i met a lot of people from different countries especially from spain and poland and germany so i am very interested in learning from the cultures
i enjoy spending my free time with my family watching movies or series also by making exercise with them hiking or walking around the house and yes
the best way to improve my english is by watching movies or series also by reading books and normals so that i can learn my skills in english
i think i would learn to read more and read faster because i am not that fast at reading so i would like to learn that to read more books and to learn more about the cultures of the world
good afternoon today we 're going to talk about if the university students should do part time jobs while they are studying some of the advantages of having a part time job while studying is that the students gain the responsibility of their actions also they gain the skill of organising more their time and also the skill of working in teams and cooperate with each other a disadvantage is that they have not much time to study so an effect is that the grades decline and they can sleep in class but in my own opinion i think it 's a good way of the students to learn teamwork and organise skills in their life
good afternoon today we 're going to talk about how the acid rain is created first the factors the initial factors are the factories and vehicles they create pollution to the air and this pollution create the acid particles in smoke this is carried by the wind and some of these particles fall in dust and some of these particles stay in the clouds and these particles are the ones that damage the environment so that is why we need to change the factors vehicles and the factories to decline acid rain
first of all they need to delete every candy they have in their house so that they can eat and start eating good food and to have healthy life like fruit and vegetables and start doing a menu
i consider that drinking water is a good form of starting a healthy lifestyle drinking two litres per day is a good amount of water to the hydratated and to be happy in your day
doing exercise is a good way of starting a healthy living you can do exercise three or four times a week not in expensive like every day
i consider that eight hours sleeping in the night is a good way of starting a healthy lifestyle
i consider technology has impact in a bad form to the healthy lifestyle because many people are now watching their cellphones all the time instead of going outside and doing exercise
well i am interested really i 'm into it
well i do n't have much free time but i draw sometimes walk around the city go sightseeing or just visit museums and i adore watching films and series
well i think with diving into the context of english language i mean watching serials and films really helps me improve my language
well i would like to take up sport classes and i think like this discipline really would help me
it 's an opinion that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying so there are some obvious advantages to this opinion first of all they would get better in financial literacy they would know how to deal with the money they earn and they would become more independent from their parents as a great advantage to this thing and i think it could be crucial for them
so i 'm gon na give a presentation about acid rain and how it affects the environment so it basically starts by vehicles and factories releasing emissions into the environment and it all comes in smoke and acid particles that are in this smoke are being carried by the wind and are releasing into the clouds or just fall as dust on the ground these particles that are mixed with the cloud they settles to the ground and forests with rain and snow and this forests are suffering from acid rain
i would recommend these people to listen to what their gut feelings tell them because they would know what food they really want and not their brain but their body wants to eat
it is essential to drink lots of water on daily basis because our body consists of water on eighty percent and it just would really start their metabolism to work better
i agree with the opinion that sleeping around eight hours a day is a key habit because if you do n't sleep enough you would be tired and wo n't be productive at all
it 's quite a questionable opinion because technologies truly help people to make their lives easier but not always they can harm health too i guess
it 's paella and it 's a wonderful rice another important point is the language spanish
on holidays i enjoy going with my family to the beach or with my friend to play football handball or another sport because it 's incredible and wonderful playing with your friends and i also play video games with my brother it 's wonderful
i personally think that i spend more time with my brother because my father is always working and this is terrible because if they are working all day i ca n't see every day and this is a terrible problem
in the future if i have the possibility i want to do nursing to help people or a policeman because they can help people and it 's wonderful and impressive to help people and gain money
students should get jobs to pay for their university studies from my point of view because the advantage of this are that you are prepares for the future and you can get money but the disadvantages of this situation are that if they would prefer to play video games or another thing they can not do it because they have to do this jobs but in my opinion i personally think that is better to do a part job not a totally job that complete all day because i think that university is to enjoy your life and then to prepare for your future and work and get money for your family because is essential
what you have to do for travelling by airplane first you have to travel to the airport then we have to check our documents in the document control with policeman it is essential that all the document will be correct because if is not correct you can not go by airplane and then you can wait in a restaurant or go to the toilet is essential go to the toilet because in airplane is difficult than other sites then you have to board the airplane and preparent for the plane because many people complained that had problems on the airplanes
from my point of view students ca n't study more efficient with technology because they can use google by computer because they can find more information than in a library and this essential for a student
and this is a problem
and this is essential for the future because nowadays companies are working in groups and this is essential for your future
and this is better than reading alone that is bored
and this is a difficult in others countries
i am very interested in know about other countries but i 'm in love with barcelona and i 'm in love with catalonia and spain too
i have a shift work so i do n't have i think enough time to have free time but i enjoy it meeting with my friends and drink some beers for example during the evenings
i think that the best way to improve my english is watching films in original version for example in english and to meet some new people that are native speakers of english and yeah
i 'm going to talk about university students if they should do part times while they are studying i think that one of the advantages that they have if they are studying and they working too is that they were earn money to spend it in their free time but maybe the disadvantage is that they do n't have enough time to study for example during a week that they have an exam but in my opinion is very important to work in a file of your own study to earn experience and practise
i am going to talk about how the pollution goes acid rain the pollution of factories and vehicles up with the smoke forming acid particles then this acid particles that are carried by wind can do two things it can be mixed with cloud water or fall as dust if they mix with cloud water then when the cloud collide fall with the rain or the snow causing damage to the environment and causing damage to the people that are in the ground
i think that it 's very important to have habits in your eating for example you have to have a schedule with what are you eating in the evening or in the morning i think that is very important
it is known that we are practically eighty percent of water in our body so it 's very important to drink so much water in our daily and during all the whole day
i think that it 's not necessary to do exercise every day during the week but it is important to doing exercise for have a good healthy so as less two or three days a week is important
i think that it 's important to sleep at less six or seven hours but i think that it 's not necessary to sleep eight hours
i think that for some people it can be affect negatively
oh it 's a beautiful island very green well to be honest just in the north it 's very green and we have like two sides the south is more dry but very beautiful as well with a lot of beaches
when i am on holidays i really enjoy be quiet relaxed maybe go to the beach and stay there alone you know listen the sea the wave i 'm trying to be relaxing
well lately i really enjoy spend time with my niece she 's very cute she 's always looking for new games and well she 's very nice i love her and i love to spend time with her
i really would like to be a potter is what i really want to do
it 's very common that students in the university have a job to pay their fees their expensive during the course but let 's see the pros and cons first it 's true that when you have a job you have more resource you can pay more things but by contrary if you spend a lot of time at your job maybe you ca n't assist to your class or be focus in your studies
the diagram show the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane in the diagram let 's start you need to arrive the airport by train or bus or with your own car then you need to check in the following you should pass the document control and security well once you are free you just have to wait sit down in a cafe or go to the toilets and wait for the departure then when you are get in board just relax and enjoy your flight
nowadays is obvious that technologies may be one of the main results for students they can use it for mainly internet to research anything they need
but i think in my opinion study by your own is really good
they can develop skills social skills communication skills working on team how to share any ideas with other people
yeah absolutely
i am really interested because i 'm studying architecture and i always pay attention how can i be respectful with my buildings to the environment so it 's really important
we enjoy going out to the restaurants drinking some good beer and eating some good tasty food
i 'm really similar to my father it 's not easy to say that but we are really similar we also do the same things in different ways but in the ending we are really similar
i would like to live near to the desert i do n't know why but the much i studied architecture i 'm more like the buildings and houses build in the desert i really love the desert
i think it 's really important for everyone to do some exercise along the week but the bad thing is that we in our everyday time we do n't have a lot of time for exercise we 're really busy so have some time in our school or colleges to do some fitness is really good for everyone and it will help to keep our health in good situation so it 's really good for everyone the bad thing is that you have to go to the college with extra clothes to change when you finish your fitness classes
i 'm really glad that this question is from honey because i am all for honey and i know really well how honey is made first of all you have a bee bee goes in the nature and bee sees a flower he goes to the flower and takes a nectar from the flower he keeps the nectar to the house there the bee makes from the nectar a honey then the beekeeper goes to the beehives and takes all the honey then they put the honey into the jar the jar goes straight to the shop and then you go to your local shop
in the first place they have to choose the language they want to learn if they want to learn italian they have to choose country where the local people speaks that language
if you study in another language that is not yours it 's becomes easier to you to learn that language faster so it 's a really good thing to you to learn a new language
first of all if you never had studied in another place where you had born it will be really difficult if you do n't speak that language of that place so that is one of the things
it 's easy you have to meet new friends from the place there are you studying then you meet local people they teach you and show you what they are supposed to do
yeah that is true because you live alone your family is not living in that place so you have to learn to do everything by yourself you have to cook you have to clean your house
it is close to the disneyland it takes twenty minutes to go by bicycle
usually i go shopping with my friends going shopping and talking with my friends reduce my stress so going shopping is good way to spend time on holiday
i often spend time with my mother we often watching movies t vs and get laughing each other
i would like to be a pilot because the pilot it 's my dream since i was four years old that is challenging job i know but i would like to be
i think all students should not get jobs but they do part time jobs because there are one advantage and disadvantage an advantage is they can know how hard to create money to live and disadvantage is their jobs is not working just studying so like doing jobs so it is really hard to create the time to study if they do the job so i think they do the part time jobs
there are six steps to do to travel by airplane i 'm going to explain each steps number one we should go to the airport and number two after arriving at airport we should go to a counter to check in number three officers check our passport number four also officers check our luggage if we do not have like dangerous items and then number five just wait to board and number six board at the airplane
students should use apps like studying apps during taking a train or buses during train or buses we have some free time so use apps to study effectively
face to face studying style is best i think because like teachers can know like how students understand the class
i think like listening skill is going to be growing up in group projects
i think attending lectures is better ways to study i mean because if he can not understand the class we can ask the teacher to teach me
is a really big town
well i really like spend time with my mum because together we can do everything but the thing i really love the most is go shopping with her because we can spend hours and hours just browsing at the shops and is really fun
the job i would like to have is to be a teacher a biologist teacher and for this reason nowadays i 'm doing a master like a master to be a teacher in the future
in my opinion for the students i think it 's a really good idea to get a job for just to pay for their university studies because i think that get a job could be a really good way to be more responsible and to know how important it is to get a job and how difficult it is to earn some money on the other hand it 's true that if the student have a job they have less time to go class or to study
if you want to travel by airplane first thing you have to do is go to the airport you can travel by car and also you can get the train or maybe a bus then when you arrive at the airport the first thing you have to do is go to do the check in then you have to left your luggage and you can take your ticket your document ticket then you have to go to the document control and then you have to pass the security control they are going to check your luggage and all your document and also your ticket to get the airplane then if you have some free time you can wait at the coffee so maybe you can go shopping to the duty free one
the good thing about the technology to study is that you can check all the things that you maybe wrote in the class and find more and more information about one topic and then you can know more and have more knowledge
i think so i think if you are learning face to face with your teacher you can ask him all the question you can have
i think it 's a really important thing to work in groups project because is really important to know how do you work with anothers you have to spend time with other people in the future job
i think is more effective because if you just read alone you do n't speak with other and you ca n't hear the others ' opinion and i think this is better for our knowledge and also for our study
i think we are not all the same and is really important to give learning facilities because maybe some people need this and is really good for them
i have a deep interested in learning about other countries it 's something that catch my attention and i think that i can learn a lot about it
being an sportive person i can say that i love go running and jogging with my friends and with my children also
to improve my english i think that the best option is to listen and to speak with other people even though it 's hard for me to do it
from since i 'm a child i have wanted learn to sew i would like to make my own clothes
i see the advantage other way the disadvantages as the first one i can say that working while you are studying you can learn other skills that are impossible to catch up in class in addition to this you can make contact with friends and with other people so you can enrich your university experience on the other hand if you are working at the same time that you are studying you have less time to dedicate to your exams as well as that usually the work schedules are bad and you by tired
acid particle cames from the factories and the vehicles since they are a good deal small it 's extremely difficult to see they travel in mixed in the fumes so that they end up in our woods as well as in the water
to start with i would say them that soda is something dangerous that they should avoid in order to improve their health and eating habits
bearing in mind that our body is almost water is something necessary and unavoidable to us drinking water
absolutely however you should remember that doing exercise is not only going to the gym but also you can doing exercises while you are doing shopping or cleaning the house for example
how many hours you need to be sleeped are different from each person to others
at this point i have a mixture of feelings and thoughts but i would like to say that although technology is something positive in general people tends to use badly
as i have said i live in mallorca which is an island i like living there but it could be difficult for those people who are not into it because if you want to go somewhere you need to take a plane and it 's not that easy
i also like being cold but i prefer on doing things which involves the sun
well that 's a difficult question because i love spending time with my family all of them but if i have to choose someone i would choose my brother because we only differ by four years and we have a lot of things to talk about and some things in common that we can compare
when i was little i always wanted to be an astronaut and that 's because i studied physics and nowadays i do n't want to be an astronaut but i do like things that involves the space
i do n't agree with this statement of this question because even though it has some advantages like for example you learn how to earn your own money and you become more i do n't know is autonom it also has some disadvantages such as do n't having free time because you are spending your time either studying or working but not spending the money that you are earning for example so my opinion is clear in that case i think we should n't but also i think that university studies should be free for everyone so everyone has the same opportunities
traveling by airplane is one of the most normal things to do nowadays first of all you need to go to the airport so you can go there maybe using some public transport because otherwise you need to pay for your car to stay there once there you need to do your check in where your luggage would be reviewed then you need to wait for your flight and go on board the plane which is usually done by groups finally you take off with your plane and enjoy your trip
they can use technology in a lot of ways
well i agree with this statement but in fact with the covid nineteen situation i would say that learning online as i have done for my english classes it 's a good way too
there are a lot of skills that can be learnt working on group but i think the most important thing is to learn how to collaborate and listen to the other people because it is important if you want to work with some people just learn to listen
yes i agree with that because if you are reading alone maybe there is something that you do n't really understand but you just skip it while if you are attending a lecture maybe these people who know how to do that can teach you
i think nowadays it is essential because with the new technologies it is really easy for them to create facilities which can help us study more effectively so i think it 's essential and they should do that
when i was a child i enjoyed going to the park to play with my friends obviously my mother come with me and also i remember that at weekends my family and me went to mountain
so i would like to work in a law office or maybe in a big company my father is a lawyer so it 's easier for me to work in a law office than in a company
that 's an interesting topic and i 'm going to start my fourth year so i 'm doing my period of practical work experience the principal disadvantage for me at least is that i do n't have enough time
ok this graphs shows how much people are visiting the sites during their first week online we can see that there are three music sites tunes net music now as songs for you there are represented in three colours blue red and yellow and we can see that the majority of people visit music now so is the the most famous site during the four first days the minority of people visit tunes net
in my opinion a team leader will be able to listen the other members of the group
the main problem probably will be that there are not enough proposal or ideas for doing the job but for me it 's not a problem
in my opinion it 's important that member of the group have different opinion because in this way they can discuss and debate and probably it will be a better solution
i believe that it 's better that the group are face to face in order to discuss the different solutions but it 's not the most important thing to have a good job
i strongly believe this affirmation because when you work alone maybe you do n't think all the possibilities
i live in a big house it has five rooms each one for my family and i have my room two beds and one bathroom and one closet
when i 'm in holidays i enjoy go to the beach enjoy my family do things i do n't usually do while i am study or doing busy things so i enjoy be happy and relaxed and also read books
i most enjoy spend time with my mother coz she teach me how to cook when we talk we are like friends and also she teach me a lot of things that i would n't learn if i talk with someone else
in the future i would like to work in a company that give me a opportunity to develop my career studies like financial management trading or something like that
college students should get a job to pay for the university most of them fail doing both things so an advantage is that you could get more money and pay your university but the disadvantage is that you do n't get the knowledge that you should get if you dedicate all the time to study sometime it 's hard to work and study at the same time
what you need to do if you are going to travel in a airplane first you have to translate to travel to the airport then you have to go to the officer and take the document control and you have to wait in the cafe or also you can go to the bathroom or just wait to your plane then you have to board the airplane and just fly that 's it have a nice flight
students can use technology to study more effectively in the ways that they can search everything they want in the web that why the internet and the cell phones and computers let us be more flexible
i think that learn face to face with a teacher it 's better coz we are in the pandemic way and it 's not easy to learn by classes online so i do n't like i prefer face to face really i understand more than online classes
if you work with a group in a project you can learn how to work in a group you learn how to share your information with other people
well in my opinion i prefer read alone coz i understand more if i do n't understand i read it and repeat it again again again until i understand but in attending lectures if you understand that 's it if you do n't sorry
it 's very important for the universities to provide learning facilities coz if the university have a level of learning facilities the students will approach all these facilities so the students are going to be in the highest level of students
i 'm really interesting in the environment because i think is very important if the environment is well our life is well too however if we do n't take care them we have a lot of problem with our lives for example
i am very similar to my father both are a lot of kind and besides we are very similar we look like equal
i would live in the same town because i think that my town is fantastic and i do n't like to move of them for this reason
doing exercise is very important to be in fit and for this reason both schools and college should make a timetable where there was a time to do fitness classes this is very important because so the student can have a rest and practice exercise however some student can would think that there is n't important and maybe they could prefer meet friends or spend their time studying or doing anything else
in the first place bees collect nectar from flowers then they make a honey from nectar in beehives when the beehives are full beekeepers collect honey and they introduce in jars when they have enough jars they transport into the supermarket by a car or by a lorry it depends and finally the jar of a honey is selling in the supermarket
the student choose another country because they want to learn another language and this way is the best for them
the advantage of studying in a second language is that you can learn another idiom
when you are far of your country you 're leave your family friends sometimes you can feel alone and this is very important for me
it depends it is n't necessary go abroad for becoming independent for example you can live with your father or your family in general but you can be independent and doing your housework and your food
my favourite time of the year is winter but also spring that is because here in spain summers are very hot and i do n't enjoy them very much
i think it is very important to be aware of the news because if you want to change something that you do n't like you first have to know that it is happening if you do n't know if it is happening you ca n't change it
as a child i used to spend my free time cycling because i really like bikes and also going out with friends playing table games with them on the street
in the future i would like to work as a receptionist because i 'm studying tourism and also i would like to go to live to london because i want to improve my english more and more
although there are lot of people that think it is not necessary to include a period of practical work experience in the degrees there is a big argument about this on the one hand including a period of practical work experience is positive because you are going to be more prepared to get into the labour market when you are out of the university also you are going to learn about things that are only learned when you are working in a different place from the university for example to have a boss and some things like that on the other hand it is difficult to include a period of practical work in that degree that have a big theoretical part because they are going to take time off from them
i think the main problem of working in a small team is that if they have a not very interest in the problem in the thing they are working on it is not going to be finished
i think that it is necessary to be face to face in order to be effective because this year for example in my degree i have been working in a work team online and it was really difficult to organise all the work and it is better to be face to face
if the components of the teamwork are very good and they are hard workers it can be better than being alone but if not maybe it is better to work by yourself
i will say quite a lot because i 'm a person who are very keen on travelling around the world and one of the most aspects that i like is to know more about the other culture
i try to take it easy honestly after i have been working so i 'm mad about making plans at the beach or in the natural environment where i can find my own peace and quiet
there are many ways to improve my english also to listen to music with the letter written down
i think it could be to learn another language as for example french because it could bring me many opportunities to develop my professional career i 'm also interested on international business
to get a job while you 're studying could have many pros and cons as everything else in life some primary advantage could be that you can obtain some savings what will be great for paying your tuition fees which are really expensive or even to hang out at the weekend with your friends
well let 's explain the process of the acid rain what is represented in the presentation or in the graphs that we have below so it has started in the factories and vehicle which are the main sources of pollution the acid particle produced in the factories are in the smoke that are carry out by the wind some acid particle normally fall as dust and other are mixed with cloud water so the final result is snow or rain that contain that acid particle provocating the damage to the environment so that 's one of the main problem that we are having nowadays with the climate change and the global warming
i would recommend them to follow a balanced diet with lots of fresh vegetable and fruit and forget about two miracle diet that promise you to lose weight so easy and fast because they are not bringing you anything good
scientists around the world claim that to drink at least two liter of water per day is fundamental to keep you healthy so i totally agree with them i consider to drink water really good for health so yeah i will follow their advice
most definitely at least to do some walk or to go run you do n't need to do a vigorous exercise but i think it 's fundamental to move a bit throughout the day
well i do n't know if you need to rest eight hour or less but what i 'm pretty sure about is that you need to rest your due time because you need to have energy to affront your next day
it totally depends in the way you use that technology it has brought us many benefits obviously as the connection with your family and friends immediately
i 'm so interested in the environment because we are living in a changeable world and it is pretty important to be part of the change and think about the environment for the future generations and to take care of them and our environment
we like to go to the cinema we like to travel to different cities or different countries we like to go to restaurants and we like to have parties at night
i am so similar to my mother people he says that i am her twin because i 'm pretty similar i am twenty three years old i have black hair black eyes and i am very thin as she is
i would like to live in italy last year i had the opportunity to travel over there and i fall in love with their customs their tradition the language and the people people is so friendly over there and the places are so pretty
i think one advantage i can find if college should make times in the school day for all students to do fitness classes is that they will have a better lifestyle and healthy lifestyle with different kind of traditions too that improve their healthy lives the one disadvantage i can find is that not all the students like to do sports some others prefers to do art activities or another kind of activities
good afternoon i am going to talk about the process of how honey is produced to start we can see in the first circle a bee and flowers it represents that bees collect nectar from flowers after they collect that nectar the bees make honey from nectar in beehives and after that beekeepers collect honey from hims beekeepers are the people who is in charge to recollect the honey from the beehives and also they are in charge in put the honey into different kind of jars it could be in a glass bottle or in a plastic bottle and after that it can be transport to the supermarket where you are able to acquire it
i think they have to consider about the documentation they need like passport or visa or other documents their language they speak their customs their traditions their religion and of course the region where it is
i think the first advantage you have if you are able to study in a second language is that you will have the opportunity to true get a better job and of course make yourself understood in that language the second language speaken the most is english
so you have to get used to to their traditions and the way they live and of course the currency of their money it 's not the same pounds or euro or dollars
well i think you have to being friendship with people who are live there so you can make friends and they can teach you how their culture is and make a good relationship
that is very nice about it
on holiday i enjoy travelling to different places i like to visit other countries or other cities and get to know them get to know their history
he 's six now he 's twenty years younger than me
in the future i would love to be a university professor i would like to teach in the area of education possibly regarding inclusion or didactics that would be my favorite job my ideal job
some advantages of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies would be that once they graduate they would already have some experience and perhaps even some idea of what field they want to go into however there are some huge disadvantages for instance students might not have enough time to focus on their university studies if they have to be working instead drop out rates might increase a lot because what would be the point of studying if you already have a job that is paying quite well certainly well enough to finance a college education in my opinion students should not get jobs to pay for university studies students should get scholarships or some other alternatives to funding
so now i will give you some very simple steps for you to travel by airplane the very first thing you need to do is travel to the airport you can do this by different means of transport such as car or bus or even the subway depending on your available options once you 've arrived to the airport the first thing you need to do is go to check in in check in they will give you some information about your flight they will put your luggage into the cargo and they will give you your boarding pass be sure you 've checked % unknown% % unknown% the permitted and forbidden objects before you go through security
for instance you can take notes faster you can record and later listen calmly or you can even use the internet to find more information about any topic you want to learn more about
i think learning with a teacher face to face can be useful for lower levels learning or young learners people who might have some trouble identifying gaps in their knowledge or self regulating their own learning
for me personally it is i can focus much longer if i 'm listening to a person than reading by myself and i also appreciate having the opportunity to ask questions or make comments and then we can all pitch in and have a greater length of knowledge
students spend very long hours in university
i 'm really interested in learning about other countries for example i really love england i have been there several times and i always try to learn anything new when i go there for example i have readen different books i have taken different classes on its culture and i think it 's really interesting
well i do different things for example lately i have taken up into cooking i have been developing my cooking skills and i have learn about different recipes but for example i also love listening to music doing sport and of course hanging out with friends so that 's more or less my free time
well for me the best way for improving your english is taking part into a community of english learning people and furthermore also in a community of english speaking people so like that you can be in contact with them and you will learn a lot by communicating with other people
well i would really love to learn how to code because i have always loved technology and computers and i have been so amazed by those programmers which can only by reading sentences they can code a new app or a new video game
well i think that taking a job while you 're studying is a really good experience for example some of the advantages will be that you will be able to learn new things which will be useful for your learning experience for example you will learn how to manage yourself how to develop other skills such as time management and how to organise yourself and who 's to be responsible for your own acts however there also will have other disadvantages for example you would n't have less time to focus on your studies and so i think it 's really important to be able to know what you can do with your time for example if you know that you are going to need a lot of time for studying you should n't take a job because it will take you a lot of time and it will not make possible for you to focus on your job or your learning of the university so even if it 's a really good experience i think that you should be really sure about what you will do
acid rain generates from vehicles and for factories so when they create pollution that pollution get up to the atmosphere there the acid particles are carried by the wind and end up mixed with other particles of water which would create a cloud that cloud would end up raining over the environment and it will have a lot of effects so for example it will cause deforestation it will cause that animals will die and it will cause a lot of environmental problems for example it could make that the terrain is not good for being able to grow things there so you will all not have only a damage to the environment but also to ourself because we have to remember that we are living of than environment so the effects that we have on them it will end up affecting also us so yeah
well the bettest advice by that i can give them is to keep track of what you 're eating so for example they can take a piece of paper and write down every day everything they take so like that at the end of the week they can compare days and they will be able to see ok in which moments i ate bad
well for me it 's really important to drink water we have to remember that we are mainly made up of water so we really should focus on that if we do n't take enough water we could have some effects as severe as depression or anxiety so by drinking a lot of water we are helping ourselves to be better
well i think that even if it 's just for a bit we should every day do exercise we can also do another type of of exercise for example like climbing or moving walking to the job
well i think it really depends on people so for example some people may need eight hours of more for being unable to have enough energy for the whole day while some others would have enough with five or six hours so i think it 's important that we know what do we really need and we try to focus on that
this really good because we can keep track of our advances
so i think it would be a good time for spend my free time with them
i think is essential listen and read news because you need to know all the success in the world and the economy and the politics so i think it could be a good idea to know the news
i used to go to my cousin 's house but then i love play basketball and go with my brother to play video games and play with other friends
okay one of the advantages of including a practical work experience in the university degrees are you could put all your knowledge in doing different type of activities that will you do in your future work however i believe one of the disadvantages is people are not focus in the different subjects that they have i think is a very big problem in my opinion i believe that have a period of practical work experience is very important for student to improve their self their knowledge and put all they have in doing a well job and have a very short experience for his future career
ok in the graph we can see three lines one red one yellow and one blue in the first the line red correspond with tune net we can see in the five first days the line is increasing the thousand of people who listen tunes net and in the seventh day a lot of one hundred thousand people listen tunes net however we can see music now is more constant and get play high level during all the week day
i think a very good team leader is a person who have got different skills
working in small groups is very difficult because you could agree or not agree with the people in your team and you have n't got different a lot of ideas for doing the work so i believe that it 's better for work in big teams
i think the contrast the opinions is very important for doing a well job
i do n't think so i believe that working in a team you do n't mind if you are working face to face or online but it is essential to have a different conversation to do a well job
so i believe that working in a team is better than working alone
well now i 'm living united states it 's beautiful and it 's a good experience because i can improve my english here
i like spending time with my friends and travelling
spending time with my parents and my sister
like to be an archaeologist
but the disadvantages is that you need to find out the time to stud and dedicate for the university studies in my opinion it 's good for you to have a half time job so you can stud and work
first if you 're going travelling by airplane you need to travel to airport you can go by car by bus or by subway or train when you get to the airport you need to do the check in and then you need to pass through document control and the security you need to wait so while you are waiting you can go to eat something or you can use the restroom or buy some souvenirs or have a coffee then you can go board in the airplane and then your flight is ready to go
technology can help you with a lot about studying and learning
if i study by myself i ca n't focus but the technology helps a lot
you need to think about someone else what is the team work so i think this a great skill and you need to learn about being responsible
i think both are great attending lectures can help you a lot with a lot of subject but i also like to read alone
the universities need to find out ways to make easier for the students to learn or for the students to want to learn for them to want to do that
the environment is n't a topic that i am very interested in
there are plenty of things that me and my friends enjoy doing together for example we like to go for a walk and have some drinks we also love to watch movies and have a great time together
i believe that the person that i am more similar to in my family is my mother in fact we are a little bad tempered but we also can be very kind and lovely with people that we care about
at the moment i do n't really know where i want to live in the future i do know that i wanna be able to travel and discover different countries to make my mind about where i want to live when i 'll be an adult
schhols and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes in fact there are many advantages about this for example students will be healthier and will have a hobby besides school there are some disadvantages for example they can be more tired and maybe if the facilities are n't modern they wo n't have showers to take a shower after they exercise
i am going to present you about how honey is produced first of all bees collect nectar from different flowers after that bees make honey from nectar in bee hives beekeepers collect the honey that 's produced from the bees and fills some pots with that honey after that truck drivers collect those pots to take them to the stores where the pots are stored and are available for customers to buy it this process is a very interesting process and shows us how nature works
there are many elements that students should count on before choosing a country for example they should see what is the rate of the university they 're choosing they also have to list their priorities
studying in a second language gives you many advantages in fact it allows you to meet new people
there are many difficulties of studying in another country in fact you have to adapt to another culture
when students are studying in another country they can learn about local culture by meeting people by going to museums or art conventions
for sure studying in a new country helps you become independent in fact you need to be organised
i am high interest in learning about other countries because i love to share the difference between cultures i appreciate the historical places the food everything
i love to spend my free time with friends especially during the weekend or in holidays because we have fun together and also with my family
i think the best way is travelling and talking with people from other countries or cities yeah also watching cinema in original version and t v shows reading is a good method too
i would love to learn how do gardening i love gardening but i am terrible with plants my plants are always like sick and i would love to learn gardening
the main advantage that a part time job while you are studying is that it 's the best way to know how your future will be about the reality of your future world of the profession that you have choose the weaker point here is that you can realise that you have chosen something that you do n't like it so in my opinion i think it is a really great opportunity to be sure about your choice and about your future because your work life will be long so you need to be sure about it
hello i 'm going to talk about acid rain and what are the things acid rain causes factories and vehicles create pollution pollution forms acid particles that are in smoke smoke carry this acid particles by the wind some of these acid particles maybe fall as dust in water and contaminate our water like lakes and the sea
in my opinion eating habits is so important to our healthy to our body to our mind so i recommend healthy eating habits to feel better
the human body are form by a high percentage of water so drink water is important to us because we need to be hydratated and we need water for our body
in my opinion is important doing exercise at least three days per week if you can do it exercise every way just a little it is more healthier than not do it
i think sleeping well is a really important to us because we need to rest so if you can sleep at least eight hours will be great for your body
it 's a good question is so important for me to learn another countries because is necessary to learn new language or new culture about the other countries and other cities
in my free time i enjoy to prepare some desserts or making some cakes or biscuits
it 's a good question let me think there are a lot of skills but i would like to learn about to be a cooker professional or something about this
hi everyone i 'm talking about this topic all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying so the first question is what are the advantages in my own opinion there are some advantages because university students can earn some money with these jobs but in the other hand there are some disadvantages because these university students do n't learn all things about their degree
hello everyone this is my presentation this is a diagram about acid rain in this diagram you can see six stage about this the first stage is pollution and this is produced by factories and vehicles then in the second stage the acid particle are in smoke and then these acid particles are carried by wind in stage four and five some acid particles fall as dust and the other acid particles mix with cloud water at the end in the sixth stage acid particle are in rain or snow
in my own opinion i firmly think drinking water it 's so important because it 's good for body and for healthy lifestyle
in my own opinion it 's not necessary to do an exercise all date of the week
depending of the people because technology for my own opinion it 's so important because you can look for all things in the internet and in a social media
there 's no such thing as free time i tend to prefer outdoor activities to indoor activities but i recognize that sitting quietly and read a book is a great way to spend my free time
certainly i believe that the best way to improve my english is speaking with my form mates and writing some articles
i would just love to learn surfing
the main advantage of doing part time jobs during the graduate could be the practical experience gained it is a noticeable fact that at the university theorical aspects are studied in deep but the practical ones are hardly ever worked however a negative aspect of those jobs is the time you invest in them it is a time you take away from your social life or from your study time
the smoke or acid particles are carried by winds but the other ones are mixed with cold waters
well to have a healthy style it 's highly important to drink a lot of water because you body need this water
yes sure i am certain agree with this i dare to say it 's extremely important in a healthy diet in a healthy lifestyle because it maintains you it 's to keep you fit
i interested by culture by the language by the monuments are there by the heat weather
for improve my english i am studying with reading listening the news in english on t v
i need for example to learn the new skill english language
i can see one advantage and one disadvantage in my opinion there are more advantage that disadvantage the advantage is if you or if the student give a part time job he can help to pay the school however if you have a part time there are a little of the your time that you can study and finish the studies there will be your first objective
there are many pollution in the world the pollution from the vehicles and the factories that the atmosphere absorb this pollution and some particles absorbed are very very acid some acid particulates fall as dust and the other acid particles mixed with the clouds
yes it 's important sleeping eight hours a day but there are some people with five six hours it 's ok and other people need to nine ten hours
he 's generally it 's positive in the hard jobs
i am interest in studying in european countries i like their culture and way of lifes
in my free time i like to read books and play computer games
the best way for me to improve my english is to talk to native speakers and watch english movies in the original vision
perhaps i would study european history
the advantages of working while studying are what you can learn extra money and gain experience their disadvantages are the high workload of student i think working while studying is good because it makes you more responsible
factories and vehicles pollute the environment acid particles get into the air and are carried by the wind in different directions some particles fall into the dust others are mixed with water acid in the clouds mix with rain and snow and fall to the ground this is how forests rivers and fields are polluted and animals die out
i try to eat what i want but at some time avoid fast food such us hamburger and cola
i try to drink more clean water to do this i have a water filter at home
i exercise every day to strengthen my leg muscles
i try to sleep eight hours a day but sometimes i ca n't sleep more than six hour
i feel good about other people 's technology because everyone has their own plan for sleeping exercising and eating
i i 'm very much interested in the environment because our healthy living depends on the clean environment so i care a lot about the environment i try not to waste or pollute air water or the land
besides i also like to watch a movie with my friends at home or theater
i 'm not sure but my relatives say that i am most similar to my father
i 'd like to settle in the countryside in future i have been craving to build a farmhouse in the countryside i want to spend the rest of my life staying close to the nature
schools and colleges should have a daily routine of physical activities for all the students there are numerous benefits of doing regular exercise a student can stay fit both physically and mentally by doing regular exercise it will help him or her to concentrate more on her studies ultimately it will help him or her achieving a better outcome and i do n't see any disadvantages of doing regular exercise unless you are overdoing it in my opinion i suggest that it should be made mandatory for every student to do regular exercise at a particular time
today we will see how honey is produced from the diagram we can see that at the very beginning the nectar produced by flowers is collected by bees in the next stage the nectar is deposited into beehives and the bees turn nectar into honey later the collected honey is poured into jars or containers and then the jarred honey is transported to shops or stores for final delivery to consumers
there are many factors a student should consider when he or she decides to study abroad first of all he or she needs to understand that the educational standard in that country is very high
the obvious advantage is that student learns different language and he understands how to communicate in that language better and besides he or she can learn about a different culture
the major drawback will be coping with the culture of the country and secondly they might not get help as soon as possible because they will have no relatives in the country
while studying abroad students can learn about the local culture by watching movies at a theater or by going to a concert with friends they also can learn about the local culture by visiting museums
i also agree that studying abroad helps a student to become independent because when a student studies abroad he or she needs to do many things of his or her own
my favourite activities to spending my time are to go to the gym going to the gym to train meet with my friends or watch t v to watch football in the t v
i think that the best the best form to improve my english is going to a place where the english is the main language like england australia u s a
i would like to be invisible because people ca n't see me when i want to make a joke for example
in my opinion the advantages of do part time jobs for university stalins are that these students have more money than the students do n't work and the students have more laboral experience but the disadvantages are that the students have less time to study to do university works
in the diagram you can see the process to generate the acid rain you first hand the pollution is generate from the factories and vehicles in the second hand the acid particles become in smoke later acid particles are carried by wind and it have two steps some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water
drinking water is an important habit because you need to maintain hydrated
yeah doing exercise is very important to maintain the physical condition and it 's essential to maintain a healthy body
sleeping during eight hours is very important to have a great rest
technology is very useful to help people to improve her body
well i never thought about the environment itself but when i like travel to the countryside i do like to appreciate the nature the trees and animals
there are many things that we enjoy doing together just like playing video games or practice some sports but i think that the our favourite activity is to go to the restaurant in dinner
but when talking about personality i think my personality is more similar to my mother 's
if i have the money and the opportunity i would like to live in taiwan that is my country home and is a very safe place safe country to live
and there are many advantages of maintain fitness classes during the school day since usually the students do n't have time to practice some sports outside the school since they are busy with their studies the only disadvantage that i see is if you make the classes obligatory
first and foremost the students should first look at the university 's reputation
there are many difficult and challenges that student may face when student abroad just like speaking a language that is not your mother tongue and adapting to a new lifestyle
i think that the best way to know the local culture of the different country is to visit the touristic places and speaking to the local people
i totally agree with that thinking because when you study abroad you do n't have your parents to support you and to help you
i live in a small city surrounded with a lot of green beaches
i prefer to go for shopping in the evening and also visiting beaches in the morning especially swimming it 's so wonderful and amazing it 's a wonderful activity which i prefer do that s in the morning
i prefer to be with my family especially my wife i love her so much we sitting make a discussion about our problem about our future and what would we do to fixes our problems and how to solve it in a good way
i did n't want to make any change in my job i just wanted to make my master degree in mathematics
nowadays the fees for university study has been increased dramatically this is wonderful if you doing this the bad thing is the drawback and the detrimental thing is that you need to focus on your study and instead of doing thesis you focus on maybe work all of the time in my opinion students should make a balance between their work and also their study in university
travelling by airplane is more important and convenient methods to travel from one country to another but first of all you should travel to the airport and try to come on time because if you did n't come on time you will miss your plane and after that you will go for check in and after check in document control they examine everything and they scan your documents after that you will go for security and they do their work in a good way after doing all of this you would wait for your plane and before your plane take off will be in the board and enjoy your plane to another country
technology is more important in student lives
when the student work in a group they learn from each other that important and they learn more about how can communicate in a group not in an individual way
i think it 's more important for a student to attend lecture because they will have everything about the lesson which was studying
it 's more important for the university to offer student modern facilities like laboratory on the internet and searching for information using internet using his tablet
my favourite day of year is summer because in summer i can go to the beach or i can go shopping with my friends or with my family
i think it 's very important to listen or read the news today thanks to the internet it 's easy read or listen news
when i was a child i remember i used to play with my brother at home or with my friends in the park i liked football
in the future i would like to be a teacher for this reason i am learning english i am studying english in a private academy because i need to pass an exam
this picture show about visit to three new online pop music site in the picture we can see in red the tunes net in blue music now and in yellow song four you and the better or more listened is music now and follow songs four you and by last is tunes net
in a small team it 's more difficult to learn
particularly i think it 's better work with teamwork because work with people is more easy
i enjoy drinking with my friend because of i like drinking the alcohol and then my friend like it too much and so i can communicate with each other more smoothly
my mother is the most similar as me firstly my character is similar to my mother and then my action is similar to my mother too
therefore i want to live in the centre of tokyo
it is saying schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes however it is advantageous because the students it forces them to work for their fitness in work out time
ok i will give a presentation about how honey is produced and secondly some bees make honey from nectar in beehives and then some bees concentrate for the honey thirdly beekeepers collect honey from beehives and then the beekeepers can drop in the bottle for the honey and then they transport to for the store
some students should consider to choosing a country with more carefully because of some countries is endangered for the serious
the students can feel a difficulty of studying in another country because of it is possible that they might be a difference in their native country
yes i agree this opinion because of the student can not rely on somebody who can communicate with their mother tongue
my city is a small one it 's built around a castle it has quite some history but i do n't think it 's very fun to live here there 's not much to do
i like to read i like to go to the beach i like to climb mountains and hike this year i 'm going camping and i think it 's going to be a pretty cool experience
so my dog it 's my dog but out of the people i think it 's my brother no my mother my mother definitely out of the people of everyone it 's my name dog his name is is fred he 's a cutie
i 'd like to be an astrophysicist
the disadvantages are that you do n't have much time to study it 's hard to relax and i do n't know spend time with your friends in my opinion it depends really if you have a lot of money you do n't exactly need a job but if you were you know poor i 'd recommend
you 're supposed to get to the airports really early so you can check in with time you check in of course you go to the document control and security checks your bags afterwards you wait for as long as it 's needed and then you get on board then you 're ready to fly
there are a bunch of programs on the internet that give you tips on studying on putting in practice your knowledge so you can get credit for tests and now with online schooling it 's even better
i speak from personal experience it is best to learn face to face with a teacher ok you are more concentrated you do n't have distractions popping up in your feed you 're not constantly on youtube or watching memes on reddit i do n't know it 's better face to face
patience you need a lot of patience you can learn how to make tea with calming properties you will need it believe me teamwork i guess yeah patience
i do n't know if you have good self control you can do things alone and it 's more effective for some people for others it is n't
so the more modern things are the better
i would like study english in other countries because i think that is essential to improve the language
i like watching t v with my girlfriend or playing football with my friends i enjoy with good company
to travel to travel is the best way to learn english because it 's the only way to improve a language
i would like learning chinese or other language like japanese russian or italian for example
i think that students should work in part time jobs if they can actually it 's necessary to work to study because there are a situation a hard situation what are the advantage the money the money and freedom what are the disadvantage they have less time to study
factories and vehicles result pollution that up to heaven acid particles are in smoke and acid particles are carried by wind this case some acid particle fall as dust an other acid particle mix with cloud water and as a result acid particles are in rain or snow damage to environment
i think that eating habits is essential is very important to have a good healthy
doctors say that drinking water is very important for healthy in anything part of the day drinking water is the best option
i think that five or six hours for a night is ok but there are people that need sleeping eight hours
place which i live is safe small and quite enough it 's a small paradise you can feel that you live in a small community
i really enjoy doing many things like swimming all day long walking going out for drink with my friends and of course having fun
when i was much younger i was n't really sure what i want to do in the future but now i am a tutor in a primary school i really love this job
some of the advantages are that they have more money to buy what they need they have more freedom from their parents the expenditures from their parents are less disadvantages may be like they may do not have enough time to stay focused and concentrated on their studies at university my opinion is that it depends on their personal opinion
this is a presentation about travelling by airplane first of all you have to travel to the airport using your vehicle your car the bus from a bus station when you will leave at the airport you have to give your personal i d or passport at the security for document control then the security will see if your i d or passport are correct then you should wait about some time until you 're aboard to the airplane and that 's all
nowadays many students use the technology as an effective way of studying and learning the technology is too useful to find any information that they need
to be honest i believe that face to face is the most important the most useful and successful way of studying and learning
for me the attending lectures are more effective of studying and learning and this is because you can learn from a teacher who gives you directions to the road to success
for me modern learning facilities at the university are so important because they give the opportunity to students to learn more effectively
i interesting a lot about country because i interesting in the culture in the know the other people other country other village i 'm interesting
normally in my free time i do the sport for example i play tennis i 'm walking i 've do yoga too because i love yoga and other sport
maybe i think that in my opinion i need an academy because i need a teacher and study every day because it 's very important for me do home or housework every day and read
maybe i think that i would learn japanese for example because i think that maybe is the language of the future and i think that is interesting too
nowadays i think that the student need work in a part time jobs because they do n't have a lot of money for pay this study i think that if they work in a part time job in have money for pay this study and in my opinion i think that this are more advantage and less disadvantage
well in this graphic you can see how the factory and vehicle cause pollution factories and vehicle cause pollution so this particle cause acid rain this cycle could cause damage to environment and i think that is very important that you help to the environment
eating habit are very important if you will have healthy
in my opinion i think that drinking water is very important because all people need drink a lot of water every day this is important for you health and you do n't have illness
i think that is very important sleep maybe not all but at least seven or six all at night because it 's very important for you will have a good day
i think that technology cause a positive effect in the people but if you use the technology a lot maybe do n't cause positive effective
i interested learning about the u k coz i have been in u k for two years ago to study english
i enjoy my free time listening music do some exercises and go out with friends
the best way to improve my english is have conversation or speak with my friends because speaking has the many skills listening and speaking
if i could learn a new skill it would be italian speaking skill because i have many friends in italy so that i wanna speak with them
so the advantages that you get from the part time job while you are studying are that you can get monies that you can use as you like and the disadvantages is that maybe there is some possibility you do n't wanna study you lose motivation and my opinion is you should do some part time jobs because i 've been doing it and i could get money and could spend money
so the first one the factories and vehicles has released many pollution and secondly the acids particles are in smoke from pollution it 's going to the air and third acids particle are carried by wind and fourth acid particles mix with cloud water and finally acids particles are in rain or snow and they cause some damages to environment
i can advise them is that you should have to think about the p f c balance you can get the protein the fat and the carbonate
in my opinion doing exercise is not necessary for every day but we should do it for five days for a week because doing some exercise is very good for our health
yeah i think also the majority of people should get eight hours to sleep but some only needs two three hours or something
i think technology has very good sides but for health i think it 's not good because before you sleep you should n't look at the smartphone because it causes by blue light
i love learning about the countries
i usually read book and play computer games
i think speaking is the best way to improve my english
i want to learn playing the piano
i think doing part time jobs while we are studying is necessary the advantage you can have some money you can spend your time to better the disadvantage is you will be tired
while the factories were doing materials they are making pollution the acid particles are in smoke and then they carry in the air by wind while they were going on the air some particles fall as dust other acid particles are mixing with cloud water and the acid particles are going to snow or rain that acid rain is damaging to environments
i think we should eat healthy food we should eat vegetables or fruits and we should n't eat fast foods
i think water is so important and we should drink eight or ten glass water every day
i think we should doing exercises at home or we can go for a walk at the park
i think sleeping is very important too and i agree that to the peoples we should sleep about eight hours
i think technology is negative effect to people and we should n't use technology very much
i 'm very interesting about learning other country especially i am very interested in historical things and events and persons
i like reading especially historical reading books is my favourite book and so i spend my free time going to library and looking for my books and reading
i believe i need to have a chance to speak english because in my division all person are japanese and so i do n't touch with english in my work
i want to improve my knowledge of control engineering because my major is control engineering and i wish to get a p h d degree on this areas
i totally agree with the opinion that all university students should do a part time jobs i believe that it 's a positive thing for student do the part time jobs because they can get work experience and money to buy something for studies on the other hand there are some negative aspect first it 's a fact that they lose time for study the duty of student is to study and so it 's a very large demerit in conclusion i think all the university student should do part time jobs
i would like to talk about how pollution causes acid rain first take a look at this diagram and after that acid particle in smoke moving up to the sky and acid particles are carried by wind and some fall as dust the others mix with cloud water eventually acid particle are in rain or snow and falling down to ground and damage to environment
i believe drinking a lot of water is very important especially in summer it is high temperature at summer and our body mainly consist of water
i totally agree with the statement
i totally agree with the opinion that everyone needs at least eight hours sleep every day because in my case actually i spend six hours sleeping every day
in my opinion generally technology has positive impact for people because we can easily get information by using internet
i enjoy spending my free time dancing mexican cultural dances this is what i love i do it every weekend and i love it
the best way to improve my english is watching some series or listening music i do it every day and sometimes i call to my friends and we start to talking in english
i would want to learn to work in teams because i 'm really impatient so i need to work on that and make that other people do their work
well i think that students doing part time jobs have some advantages some disadvantages of doing that is that they have less time for themselves and it 's a really hard life to have because the time is n't enough in my own opinion i think that this is a good way to start in the business area
okay first the industries make pollution and the acid particulars travel with the smoke then the acid particulars are carried by the wind and some of this fall as dust other of the particulars mix with the cloud and when it rain or snow these fill like acid particles in the environment and this could be very critical to all people
drinking water is really important for people because this way you can stay healthy and you can refresh your brain and apart of that this make you functional
yeah doing exercise every day is really important because this way you can stay stable and this mixed with some good eating habits you will be fit and reduce some grace
yeah sleeping at least eight hours it 's good because this way your body can rest during this hours
well actually technology has a positive point in the life of the people because people staying in house could start doing some exercise
i 'm very keen on learning about other cultures because for me it is interesting to see how other people from different parts of the world live and the way they live is very interesting for me and i can find out more interesting and useful things to learn for example it 's very interesting for me
in my free time i enjoy going for a run in the forest or in the park where i can get fresh air and meet interesting animals or plants and i also play tennis with my best friends in the sports hall and another thing i travel a lot in my spare time
best way to improve my english is to go abroad where i can meet a lot of native speakers and they can help me improve my english and at the same way i can get a lot of information from the culture where the language is spoken and the way people live in their country
if i want to improve my skills i will choose communication skills because it 's very important nowadays to communicate effectively for example if you have a problem you need to explain it properly to people to make them understand your problem
it is very important to do part time jobs while you are studying if you do n't have enough time of course and the advantage of this is that you can get a lot of experience at work and see how it works with working in teams for example and you can also achieve goals in many areas such as sharing ideas with others and get a feedback from experienced workers and the disadvantage of this is that you have got a lot of tasks for university studies and for this you need a lot of time so in this situation part time jobs would n't be suitable and in my opinion many students should try it because it is very useful
well first of all factories produce products and while they are producing them they also produce dangerous elements which go up to the air and it causes a lot of pollution and then the next step is that acid particles are in smoke and the next stage is acid particles are carried by wind and then wind carry them in the air to other places and their fourth stage is that some acid particles fall as dust five other acid particles mix with cloud water the next step is acid articles are in the rain or snow and the other problems with pollution are caused by vehicles many transport are used by many factories and other companies and then we should reduce the transport
well first of all they should eat more fruit and vegetables as they contain a lot of vitamins which can improve their health and in the morning people can have cereals as breakfast and they should drink a lot of juice as well
it 's very important to drink lots of water because our body needs it to stay alive and to be more active by this i need a lot of water and we should drink it as it 's life
and everyone needs exercises to be more active and physically develop
i think that everyone needs at least eight hours a day sleep because our brain needs the rest after busy days
generally speaking in my opinion technology has a positive impact on our life because nowadays we can easily get information from the internet for example or from other resources as well and we can save our lives
well actually i enjoy watching t v sometimes i go out with my friends to play soccer and i play the guitar and yeah that 's it
well i think with my sister because she is just kinda my age and we 've got the same tasty
well i think the advantage would be that the students could earn their own money and so they could be buy anything that they need and the disadvantage could be that they ca n't study and maybe they get stressed because they are working and studying at the same time well in my opinion the students they could be working and studying at the same time because you can get money
well first of all you have to get any way of transport for example get on the bus then it will take you at the airport and you have to check in then it will be document control and the security maybe stopped you for find out about you and some like this then you have to wait for a moment and then the plane would be board
i think the students use the internet because on internet there is all and they can investigate about any topic and they can learn about all
yeah i think so because have a teacher with you is the better way to learn any topic because you have a teacher who help you about any question that you have
well i think they could do your homeworks faster yeah and making friends and get along well
it 's very important because the university should have the better learning facilities of materials because university is the most level school i think so
i have a son and i like to spend my time with him and with my husband and also i like to spend time with my friends or i have a small land in countryside and i like to work in my garden
the best way i think that will be with a teacher or if i will have the opportunity to go abroad because you have the opportunity to practice with the people
and there are lot of people that know these languages
i believe that it 's important that all the students spend some time in a part time job while there are a student because when you are working you learn different things that you are study you learn how is the real life and you have the opportunity to be responsible with your work and this is important for your future also you can learn about something that is involved in your studies and with this work you can get other knowledges different that you are learning in your class
i 'm going to explain you how is produced the acid rain as we can see in this picture we have a lot of factories and vehicles that produce pollution then these particles down to the all rainforest like a rain or snow and because of this damage all environment so also some of these acid particles fall as dust and i think it 's important to reduce this pollution to avoid problems like that
i will tell to these people that should to eat more vegetables or fruits than other foods like fast food or something like that because these foods are better than the other ones
in my opinion i think it 's important to do exercise not only eat good food or drink enough water
i think the technology is not positive for your health because the waves that are producing are not good for the people
so my hometown is very international city
nowadays i usually go abroad to travel i like travelling all over the world and enjoy a lot of culture there for example local foods and talking with local people
i spend my time with my dog he likes me very much so i always walk with him and often play with him
pilot go all over the world
the advantages if students pay the university the studies students can choice everything if their parents pay for it students have to follow the educational policy next the disadvantage of this topic is if students work very hard they do n't have enough time to concentrate on their study it prevent them from doing deep learning so in my opinion the most important thing is for students is study so students have to concentrate on their studies and get skills that help their future then they can get a lot of money
i would like to talk about how to travel by using airplane first you have to go to the airport by using cars trains and the bus when you arrive at the airport first you have to go to check in counter then you have do check in then you can get boarding pass next you have to go to document control there your passport and some documents will be checked then you have to go to security in the security area your baggage and your luggage and also your body are checked for safety then after finishing it you can wait in the airport you can go to the cafeteria restaurant and so on
so by using that they do n't need to actually hire somebody to teach them what they do n't know they can just use the internet to find out what they need right
if it 's not face to face that 's little bit harder right
ok by group projects you can gain cooperation and also by doing group projects you can get your own part so you have your own responsibility to finish whatever you need for the project right
attending lectures are more effective than reading alone because there is a part of you want to go in to see and somebody is actually talking to you is better than you just reading from a book that somebody wrote
i think is very important for universities to give modern facilities because students they are going to university will need it and if does n't have that kind of modern facilities well there 's not much meaning of going to university at all
i enjoy spending my free time with my friend playing catch ball with my friend in the park nearby and exercise is very good for good health
i think i similar to my mother it 's because my mother she likes talking i like talking too so is very similar and she is very nice woman
i would like to talk about schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes first the about advantages i think it is exercise doing it is very important for them to exercise because they become more healthy so in my opinion i think all students should do fitness classes it can be healthy
i would like to talk about how honey is produced first bees collect nectar from flowers second bees make honey from nectar in beehives and third beekeepers collect honey from beehives then they collect honey on the bottle finally they carried by car and display merchandise so in conclusion i think it is very very delicious honey i think it is nice thank you
i think it is useful to work in the future i have a second language it is very useful for works in new places
i think at the first time they have to speak another country language is very difficult so they can study english very well every day
i think so too
i enjoy spend my free time watching t v series i think i spend quite a lot watching t v serial like my favourite t v serial is big bang theory
i think the best way is speaking with my sister and with other persons so i can improve my pronunciation and also watch t v series on the t v for the learn new words
i think i would like to learn how to write but write a book or something like that because i think i am the worst in writing
i think students should do part time jobs because some advantages are that you can create new skills you can have more experience and also you can create new relationships for your work and maybe for your personal life and some disadvantages are that maybe like a student you do n't have a lot of time and if you have a job and also you need to study it 's gon na be difficult and for that you can forget about other relationship like your parents and something like that and i think it 's the worst idea to lose those relationships because you focus only in your job and in studying but i think it 's the best way to have experience in the real work
as we can see in the presentation factories create that pollution and also vehicles and that create of that pollution that create acids particles that are in form like smoke and then those particles are in the air because of the vehicles and factories and that create acids particles that mix with cloud water and that water like we can see is useful for the tree but when that acids particles are in the rain they affect on those plants because they need water and the water is something that in the planet is essential
for example they do n't eat good because they do n't know how to cook or maybe what product they should buy
i think drink lots of water is important because our body needs that
not every day maybe three or five days a week because our body needs to rest and is something that a lot of people they have a different opinion because they think they need to exercise every day
i think we need to sleep like eight hours because our body needs to rest and if we do n't sleep enough is gon na be difficult for us to have a good day in the next day that we wake up
and also there are some apps that motivate people to do excercise and drink water
i 'm not really sure because every time of the year have good things and bad things but i think i 'd say summer which is the time of the year where i can go to the swimming pool with my friends or to the beach doing more things
well it 's bad point from my point of view but i 'm not interested in news i see the news while i 'm eating on the t v because i eat with my father but i do n't read the newspaper and i do n't listen to the radio so i 'm not interested in the news
i loved going to the park with my friends which were my friends of the school and also my neighbours because all of us lived like in the same area of the city
i 'd like to maybe be the boss of a big company and maybe working abroad because i do n't think i 'd be able to work here in spain so i 'd like to work in a big company with international issues maybe exportations or importations
i think practical work experience it 's really important before graduating but not all the courses should practice this because for example in a first course you are just giving students the first notions of what they are studying so they are not prepared to have the responsibility of do any work for any practical work experience so from my point of view it 's important but in the last courses like in third or four of the degree that they know what should they do if they have a problem in a work experience
okay so in this graph we can see three music sites so the first one is tunes net tunes net starting with twenty thousand of people then the second one is music now the music now started high and is still high but well it has increased but it is under the red line
and you not need to be the boss you do n't have to give orders you have to involve with the team and work with them maybe work more than them
but if you are less people you have to do more work per capita so i think by the way it 's good to control but it 's bad because you have to work more
i think it 's very good and very healthy to have different opinions and different point of views because like that we can do a better job and we can share ideas than if we were all would that we all agree but i do n't think it 's really good though
i think it does n't have to be face to face in order to be effective i mean you can do an online reunion or whatever but i think it 's better to do it face to face because you can see others ' ideas more clearly
i totally agree with that statement because if you are working in teams another one could have a better idea about what you have n't even thinked so i think it 's really good to have other points of view to share your ideas and maybe you 'd be better in other areas
i 'm very interesting in learning about other countries and other cultures i think it 's always interesting to know culture so different from your own
i enjoy spending my free time watching t v series or playing games or reading a book i also like to go to football matches with my friends
well in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing speaking or practicing watching series or playing games in english or reading a book in english so practice is the best way to improve my english in my opinion
i would love to learn painting so i could paint my own pictures and hang them in my house and maybe even give them to my friends
i 'm going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of students doing part time jobs while they are studying in my opinion one advantages will be that working at the same time that studying gives you a sense of responsibility about your life because you have to provide yourself for yourself but on the other hand i think that working at the same time that you are studying could be affect negatively your academic life because maybe you 're tired after working to start to studying properly so it will affect your grades so in my opinion there are some advantages to work while you 're studying but maybe the disadvantages are worse
i 'm going to give a little talk about acid rain acid rain forms firstly when the pollution emitted from the factories goes into the air in the form of particles that are in the smoke then those particles are carried by the wind some of those particle fall as dust polluting lakes and our forest the rest of those particles mix with the cloud water and then forms clouds and when those clouds rain or snow the acid particles goes into the soil polluting our trees and our forest and our lakes
well i think that the advice i will give to people who want to improve their eating habits will be do not skip any meal and try to replace as much meat as you can with vegetables to try to reduce the meat you eat
oh i think it 's very important to drink a lot of water you should try to eat at least two liters of water per day
well maybe not every day but at least three four times a week you should do exercise there 's no need to do some heavy exercise you could also just go for a walk or trying some light exercise at least try to move every day
oh i completely agree that we need eight hours of sleep every night problem is that you ca n't always get them because you maybe have to rise early in the morning to go to work or study so it 's always complicated but definitely you should try to sleep at least eight hours
well honestly i think that technology has have a bad impact in our lifestyle because it 's make people more sedentary and they move less eat worse maybe work at home
i would definitely say that my favourite time of year is christmas because everyone is together we have some holidays
when i was seven years old i was a coach potato i enjoyed being in a sofa watching cartoons
as i said before i will love to work as a teacher because i was studying for four year my degree that 's for being a teacher and i will love to be the best teacher ever
it was my vocation
according to the graph related with the trainee online pop music site that they were visiting during their first week online we can see that music now it was the most popular and on the other hand the tunes net started being the less popular one but it was the most popular during the last day the last one ok
for my personal point of view i think it has to be someone with an open minded who motivate their workers
one of the most common problems during work teams is the fact that some people are lazy and they avoid to focus on their work
absolutely i think we have to be open minded in order to work with different people because everyone can have different aspect so we have to listen to everybody and try to change our work until it 's perfect
not necessary currently we are working in a problematic situation that we have to doing our work online i think that with some application we can share our feelings our opinions
i could n't agree more because from a personal point of view i think you can always learn by your partners because they do n't think like you so they can have more creative ideas
i 'm really keen in environment because in the future if we do n't look after the environment we wo n't have enough water to drink or similar like that
we are unalloyed fan of the cinema in fact all weekend we usually go to the cinema
definitely i take after my grandfather in fact all people said that i am his son
in the future i would like to live in somewhere else but i do n't know when exactly but at the moment i 'd choose england i think
i could n't agree more with this sentences because the sport is one of the most important thing to feel you healthy and with energy in fact when you doing sport you feel over the moon and you will have more energy to study or doing anything the only disadvan that i can see in this advice is that you wo n't have more time to learn about other subject like maths and language or history or similar
at the beginning bees collect nectar from the flowers in the country after that these bees make honey from nectar in beehives and so beekeepers can collect honey from that beehives after that they manufactured the honey and they repart this honey in different shop than the customer can buy paying for them
there are a lot of advantages but the most important from my point of view is that you will able to learn other language
to learn about the local culture they must meet new people from this country to learn more about their food or relationship and language
i could n't agree more with this advice because you must to be independent to live in other country because you will be alone and you must to do all thing alone
i interest in other language and other countries ' cultures
commonly i watch some movies from netflix and i am walking near the river and i 'm listening music
i think the best way is speaking native people and read some thing
i want to learn speak a few language easily and also i want to learn play some musical instruments
i think it have some good aspects if you are working at the university you can earn money for yourself and you can be independent person also you feel so self confident and of course there are some disadvantages you have no much time for entertainment or hanging out with friends and you can feel exhausted
factories and vehicles caused pollution and pollution have some acid particles in smoke the acid particles are carried by wind in the sky and it caused some acid rains some of the acid particles fall as dust in earth some of them mix with cloud water and acid particles are in rain or snow and this circle this acid rain circle damage the environment
people who wants to have healthy lifestyle eat some vegetables and fruits regularly
in my opinion people should doing exercise every day because doing exercise can good for body health
i agree with this view because our bodies are tiring during the day so we need rest our bodies
it can be change it depends on using people 's using
this is my hometown
on my holiday i usually spend my time with my mum and my dad we usually go to the beach and take sunbathe
i think that 's with my mum she is very lovely and have fun she also give me some useful advice for my problems
i 'd like to become a teacher because i love children and i want to help them to broaden their knowledge and i want to help them to gain some social skills to prepare for their future
nowadays many people believe that all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies there are both advantages and disadvantages for this first of all if students gets a jobs they can earn their living and also get more money for their study expense and they also can support them for their study free but if they spend most of their time doing part time job it ca n't affect badly on their study
the diagram illustrates the stages people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all they need to go to the airport by any means of transportation they can get such as car bus or train and after that if they reach to the airport they should go to the check in board and shows their passport and something like that in the document control after that they would check their luggage their suitcase with the security employee
yes i support this idea nowaday even when we study online we comes for some problems especially if your technology is not good enough
of course is more interesting to attend lectures than to read some material some documents alone because we can hear the voice
the place where i live it 's very kind because the people are with very facilities and also the place have a lot of culture and touristic places
when i am in holiday i love go out to vacation and go to the beach with my family and also i enjoy reading books about architecture
i enjoy spending time with my brother because he 's very funny and also i love stay with my father but i prefer stay with my brother because he is very spontained
well i do n't really see myself doing the same job as i 'm doing now because i would really like to keep on improving and to keep on being promoted and be one of the best architects
to be honest i think the government needs to pay us for study because our job is to be prepared to the future and also be prepared to the objectives of the life and our objective is take a good job and also do the change in our area where i live
in my opinion like a student we need to technology to improve our skills and also to improve our knowledge
i preferred to work alone but the group projects i know that helps us about to be a leader and also to understand how the other options could be good
i think that the way to everyone learn is very different so i think the learning facilities will be change because everyone have their manner to learn
i am very interested in learning about other countries and cultures
i enjoy spending my free time with my kids with my husband my family and i love also reading books watching series on netflix and eating a good meal with my family
i would love to learn embroidered and i would love to improve my studying skills
we see many university students working part time jobs while they are studying and i think there are many advantages to that students firstly would have their own income and that would allow them some economical independence from their parents as well as becoming more responsible in their money management the disadvantage though is that if they need to work while attending classes as they would have to time manage between their work duties and their university responsibilities in my opinion i think it 's better if the students university students do part time work while they are studying but i would advise them to do so during their summer breaks as they would get the best of both worlds
one of the many problems caused by air pollution it is certainly acid rain in areas where there are many factories and vehicles they can release a lot of pollution to the air that contain acid particles that go up in the form of the smoke these acid particles are carried by the wind and some of them fall as dust but others get mixed with clouds and that can in turn fall as in the shape of rain or snow causing damage to the environment such as crops and water supplies
the first advice on eating is start to include your five a day in your diet and another very important step is to cut out junk food and sugary foods from your meals try to stick to three meals a day and healthy snacks in between
experts say we should aim to drink about two liters of water a day it 's very important to keep our bodies hydrated and functioning well like for me anyway if i do n't drink water i get headaches and things like this
i do n't think it 's essential to do exercise every day i think it 's important to have a regular and consistent routine experts said we should exercise three days a week and i think that would be a good focus
i would n't say everyone needs eight hours ' sleep per night i know that i work better if i have between eight or nine hours ' sleep but i know some people that can not sleep any more than six or seven hours
generally speaking i think a little negative but that 's because we do n't know how to control ourselves and to put limits in the amount of time we spend in front of screens be that the phone the t v or computers but if we know how to manage our time i think technology is great
well i 'm really interested in the environment and right now is pretty sad would say that the environment is being damaged so i definitely think that we need to take action right now to protect our environment
well we often doing some sports during the free time so doing this not only can we keep fit but also we can develop our friendship which is i think really great
i think i am mostly similar to my dad because we often read books together and we both love writing articles
well i like to live in new york in the future because new york is a really multiculture city and in fact i visit new york once last year and i was really amazed by the city new york is a great city
some schools and colleges think that they should make time in the school day for all students do fitness classes well there are definitely some advantages to do this for example through doing sports not only can students keep fit but also they can learn how to do the teamwork which is very important to their future career however every coin has two sides there are some disadvantages as well for example spending too much time doing sports may result in a poor academic performance so as far as i 'm concerned it is essential for students to learn how to balance schoolwork and sports only in this way can they have a better future
hi everyone today we are going to talk about how honey is made well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and then they make honey from nectars in beehives after several days beekeepers collect honey from beehives and then they will put them into jars and once this procedure is done these jars will be putted onto the vehicles and they will be delivered to supermarkets all around the country where you can buy them and take home and enjoy them so this is how honey is made this is how honey come from flowers to the shop that 's all thank you
well students need to consider a lot of things to choose a country for example they may consider whether they like the food in those countries whether the weather is great and so on there is a lot to consider
well i think foreign students may find it difficult to make friends or fit in with local students because they grew up in two different cultures and the cultural difference can prevent them from being together
well i think foreign students can ask local students to share something about their unique culture because those local students have lived in this country for many years and they definitely have a deeper understanding about their culture
well studying abroad can definitely help a student become independence because in a foreign country there is no relatives and you need to solve all the questions on your own it 's really challenging but it can also benefit you a lot
when i am on holidays i enjoy relaxing of course i enjoy swimming to the beach or to the swimming pool for example or going out and visiting the city where i am
normally i enjoy spending time with my brother because we have similar interests so every day we play together with video games
i would like to job as a occupational therapist actually i am studying for that but i would like to job as a physiotherapist too it 's one of my dream so i would like to get
in my opinion i think that it 's normal that students get jobs to pay their university studies because actually university studies are very expensive the advantage is that you will earn money easily because you are working the disadvantage is that you have n't got a lot of time to prepare your subjects in the university so you have less time than other in my opinion i think that it 's normal because university studies are very expensive but it 's very hard to do this
firstly you need to travel to airport and go to do the check in when you are waiting you can drink or eat or go to the toilets and when called you to board at the plane you will take off and go when you want to go
i think that it 's a good option to understand all doubts that you have for example if you do n't understand anything in relation with the unit that you are studying a teacher could help you
i think that attending lectures it 's a good option to understand things that you do n't know for example if you do n't understand what the teacher has said attending lecture will help you for that
universities want to improve these modern learning facilities because thank of that the students could understand more easily all the information
my favourite time of the year is absolutely christmas i really love the atmosphere but also the cold atmosphere the weather like snow also rain i really like rain well i think it 's the best time of the year
i think it 's really important to read news like the local ones newspapers but also in the web on internet
when i was a child i really loved i really like to stay in contact with nature i was always outside outdoor playing ball and i do n't know maybe use the rope
well i would like to become an engineer in particular a biomedical ones
i completely agree with the fact that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience indeed i think that the main advantage of include a period of practical work experience consider the fact that probably after this practical work experience students can find a job and also improve their practical ability i think well the main disadvantage of this factor is the fact that probably peoples will think that it 's like a waste of time and because they can study while they were working well in my opinion i would like to include a period of practical work during my studies
these graph shows the number of people visiting these three different sites tunes net music now songs for you during their first week online we can see that in the vertical axis there are the percentage of thousand of people and the days of the week are shown in the horizontal one we can see that from the fifth day to the seven days tunes net had a climb and there is a drop for example in for the songs for you a slightly drop for music now
i think that the main characteristic of a team leaders are ambitious also collaboration and enthusiasm i think that these three are the most important characteristic of team leaders
i think there is only one problem with a small team well the fact that if a group are small probably there were only few ideas and this is a disadvantage
i think that the most important things is the collaboration obviously members ca n't always agree with the sentence of other member but it 's important to come to a conclusion
yeah i think that it 's very important create a face to face team rather than a online group i think that face to face team could create more collaboration
i completely agree with this sentence i think that the best results for group are possible if only they collaborate and they are open minded and they accept others ' ideas
i always eat dinner or go shopping with my family and the weekend chat with each other to understand what they are going on
i think it 's my mom i always share my daily life with my mom and then she always provide me some suggestion so we are very familiar in this
and in my opinion i think i agree that the student have the fitness class when they are in the schools because they can then be more concentrated in next class
the honey from flower to shot the first thing is that a bee collect nectar from flowers and the bees make honey from nectar in beeshifts and after that the beekeeper collect honey from the beeshifts and the beekeepers make the honey and they put the honey into the jam and after that there is a car on delivery honey to the shot so the shot sell the honey
i think need language is an important thing if a student want to learn the english then he or she will choose a english speaking country
the advantage of studying a second language is that he or she had a more languages communicating skill to communicate with others
and for example for the festival it can be for other local culture
i totally agree that the student studying abroad can be independent because the students need to do everything by themselves
it has a river it has a beach the beach is near of the town and also there sunset is amazing
when i 'm holiday i enjoy to swimming in the pool and also playing music i enjoy improving my skills in my instrument my favourite instruments are guitar and drums
i play with it i eat with it
well one advantage that i found to get a job to pay the university is that it make the students more independent so they apart they pay the university they also buy everything they want but one disadvantage is they maybe spend more time in their job that in their studies so in my opinion if they have the time to work to get a job to invest time in their job they can do it but if they do n't have this time it 's better if they just focus on their studies
nowadays technology is one of the most important tool to learn because they can find a lot of information in the internet
in my experience i think that it is correct because now with the online classes the learning it 's more difficult and i think the face to face is better
one skill that i consider all students can develop is the teamwork the teamwork for their jobs is an important skill that they can construct and build
well it depends of each student for example for me it 's more effective read alone because i do n't distract with other things but for other students it 's more effective read in groups
it 's important but maybe not the most important
in holiday i enjoy with my friends to play tennis to dance and other things that when i study i do n't realise
i think that with my brother he is two years old than me i love to pass time with him
the advantages that student get jobs to pay their university studies is certainly that they pay their studies but if they work they wo n't have time to study if they do n't study they wo n't pass their studies
first people travel to airport with car bus train or the other transports or vehicles in the airport first people check in and pass document control or security then people wait in cafeteria or visit stores or the other stops
in my opinion is best learning face to face with the teacher but i think too that is important support with books or search information on internet
i think that with attending lectures the students learn different things that alone do n't stop to learn
it 's important because the world are change and the students needs modern learning facilities to learn more and different things to the future
i really like spending time with my great grandmother i really love her i think it 's one of the most valuable persons in my life
in the future i will like to become a classical philology teacher because i really love like showing my knowledge to the students
in my opinion it 's great that some students want to get jobs to pay for their university studies i think that is a great way to earn experience and earn more money in order to help them pay for their university fees but also on the other hand i think that way if they get a job they are wasting time on doing like i 'm going to work when they should be or could be studying and in my opinion like you know if they have enough money to pay for their university fees without troubling their family i think they would n't have to get a job if they do n't wanna but if they do need the money i think it 's a great idea
hello today i 'm going to explain you how to travel by airplane first of all you get a travel to the airport then once you are already there you should do the check in after that you go to document control where a guard should check your documents and see everything is clear and in order and valid and after that you just have to wait and when they tell you to you should board the plane and get ready because the airplane would launch soon
well i think technology is a great way to improve your studying techniques
i think that human interaction ca n't be changed or replaced by technology so i think face to face interactions with a teacher is best is the best way to learn
i think that by working group projects students learn how to co operate how to share and divide work in order to get something done faster
in my opinion if the person who is giving the lecture is a good speaker i think attending lectures is the best way to get the information right and to understand everything
i think the university should adapt to the world is this growing and improving
i am very interested in learning about other countries ' culture because it is very interesting for me learning about other things other customs traditions
when i have free time i like watching t v or watching youtube videos tiktok or watch a series
the method that i use is to practice four skills listening speaking writing or reading these four skills for me are very important to improve my skills in english
actually i want to learn how to play another instrument i actually know how to play the piano and i also sing and i want to learn a new language that is korean i want to travel to south korea
i think that the advantages of do part time jobs while you are an student is that you can be prepare for real life and the problems which haves solutions to problems some disadvantages is that the students need to organise the your time very well to study and for the part time jobs and i think that university students should n't do part time jobs because they need to be concentrated on what they are studying
hi to everyone the first step of the acid rains to create is the first pollution then the acid particles are in smoke and they are carried by the wind some of the acid particle fall as dust and the particles mix with cloud water and that is how the acid rain is form and we can find some acid particles in rain and snow
a recommendation that i can give the person is that if he or she wants she can go or he can go to a nutritionist to give him or her tips for his or her eating habits
well in my opinion it is very important because our body is made up of water in the seventeen percent so that is why all doctors recommend to drink almost two liters of water a day
well some recommendations in my point of view doing exercises every day it 's an option but you can also do twice or three times a week
it is very important the time of sleeping because there is when we recharge our batteries or our energies it is very recommended by doctors to sleep almost eight hours
so at summer we usually just bike down to the beach and it 's really sunny here but sometimes it 's a bit windy and it 's blowing really hard the wind is really harsh
i really enjoy spending time with other family members but also to like swim play go shopping and eat lots of food i really love tasting other types of food from other countries
i think that 's going to be my sister since both of my parents they are a lot older than us of course
i do n't know at the moment but i 'm thinking about becoming a doctor but i 'm thinking about it because you know to become a doctor you have to study a lot it 's a lot of math and it 's just really hard so i 'm still thinking about it
if there are many jobs that are available this is really great opportunity for all the students to get jobs to pay their university studies but some students do also have parents who pay for their university studies which is not as good the disadvantage is as i mentioned before if you are working while you 're studying at the same time it can affect your grade in a bad way and in my opinion it 's good to get job to pay for your university studies so that you do n't have to borrow or lend money from your parents or the bank yeah not good to lend money but it 's not good either if you 're failing your tests
so before you travelling by airplane of course you have to travel to the airport first so you can choose between car bus or train i recommend taking bus or train because if you 're driving with car to the airport you have to pay for the parking so obviously it 's not worth if you 're paying for a ticket when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and they will go through document control and security and your baggage and then you can just wait at the airport perhaps go to the toilet eat some food and buy some gifts and when your plane has arrived it 's time to board and then you just wait for your airplane to start flying up to the sky
you can go on to websites to find feedback technology you can write on computers which is much easier than to write on paper but i recommend writing on paper because you will remember the text a lot better
i think exactly the same during this pandemic we have been having online classes the whole time and it has been a lot harder to understand what teachers are talking about when you 're asking questions is also a lot harder for them to understand when you guys are not face to face
you know you can take other ideas from others and build your own
sometimes yeah it 's depending on like which subject and what it is about but attending lectures is a really good way than to study alone because lectures are not available the whole time but you can always study by yourself so if you have chance do it
according to me it 's really important for the students to have a great modern learning facility for them to concentrate and a facility that works for everyone and that will be silent modern technology for everyone to work
barcelona is so beautiful it 's amazing but based on my opinion i think there is so much pollution and so many people
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy travelling around the world and discovering new places
with my father because we have a lot of common things such a playing computers games
nowadays i work as a waitress but i would like to work as a hospitality management
based on my opinion we have a lot of advantages of working and study at the same time for example you will be more efficient more organised you will appreciate your spare time as well and of course earning money is so difficult nowadays you have to appreciate it the disadvantages is the time you will have no time to be with your family or with your friends or doing the things you really love
good morning today i am going to explain what you need to do to travel by airplane to get to the airport is not very difficult quite the opposite it 's simple you need to get there by bus by car or by train once you are there you have to do the check in and leave your big suitcase then you will pass document control where you have to be ready with your i d and your passport if everything is ok you will go to the security where a guard will check your belongings and then the all you have do is waiting you can take a coffee you can go shopping you can go to the bathroom take some food and when thirty minutes before you will go to your gate you will go into your plane and the all you have to do is to enjoy your journey
i reckon google is a really good app to search different information and to learn new things but just if you know how to use it so i suggest searching in different websites
i reckon face to face is much better because based on my opinion that i am studying a master online it 's so difficult when have doubts i have to write an email and wait one day until someone reply to my email
although i consider myself as a individual person i know that working in groups is much better because you have new ideas you are more efficient you can talk with more people it 's better
based on my opinion i think it 's much better reading alone because for me i hate reading with noises around me or someone who is talking about another thing or different kind of noises it 's so annoying
the world is changing day to day and we ca n't stay on the past this is the way that we are going to learn new things obviously
a lovely country style cottage
vacation maybe around the world
of course my mother my father my brother and younger sister
a dentist a doctor a teacher or maybe a firefighter
working while studying can be great way for you to make a little bit of extra money although it does have its disadvantage those are usually drastically outweighed by the benefit that it brings that probably why nearly eighty percent of student work part time while studying of course it 's not necessary the right decision for everyone and there 's a real risk that if you spend much time working and not enough time studying you may not achieve the grade that you were aiming for as with most thing in life the key to success is to have a healthy balance which is why it 's good idea to limit your working hours if you do decide to take on a job while studying but we recommend it if you can and here 's why
travelling by airplane before you reach to the airport you have to travel to the airport by public transport and then after that the next process it will be document control they have staff over there to help you to control all the documents and then have a security check you need to wait to the gate and then have some wait time during the wait time maybe you can go to the washroom and then shopping and then having a lunch in there after that you will be on board so when the on board time you can depart so
you will be able to concentrate harder on your learning because there will be less distraction than if you were at home
person training provide better opportunity for group activity and interactive project individuals will find they learn more working with other who really want to take as many traditional classes as possible face to face interaction can also provide more networking and opportunity
basic facility that every school should provide to the student are ventilation and air quality lighting temperature control space and size of classroom
i 'm interested in the environment because for example in my country they is a lot of pollution
well my friends and me sometime go to the cafe because we are a lot of relaxing and comfortable
she have glasses with me
in the future i like live in malaga this is a big city in the south of andalucia in this city also they are a lot of people and a lot of shopping centre
i think that is a good idea and there some advance is the student can be more relaxing and comfortable for their other subject in the school or university
i am explain to make honey in the first place the bees collect nectar from flower then some bee make honey from the nectar in beehive and a man or woman that is beekeeper collect honey from hive after the women or woman put the honey in the cup
i am study a second language this is english because it is necessary for me in the university studies
i think that the more difficult of studying in another country is who you no can see your family but in this country you can be a new friend
well i think that the local culture is very important because you can eat a lot of food in this country and is very interesting of know the culture local because the people are very happy in this country
i enjoy to learn about the culture of the country it 's something that interesting me a lot
i like to read in my free time
for me it 's primordial to learn every day at least one word because will help you to improve your vocabulary that is really important
it would be a better communication because for me it 's really important to everything
the advantage is that the person will have more experience and will create more responsible and will have more opportunities and disadvantage is the time because the person will stay without time to do other things and that can harm the mental health
hello today i talk about the acid rain let 's go first the vehicles and factories cause pollution then acid particles are in smoke and acid particles are carried by wind after some acid particles fall as dust and after that others acid particles mix with cloud water and finally acid particles are in rain or snow and it 's just this but it 's a topic really important
firstly you want is really essential
it 's important for our body because our body is composted for much water than it 's really important to a good health
for me it 's really important to have a better disposition and a good routine in a day
for me balance it 's everything to do better things in technology
that 's a very beautiful city and its culture very good
in my holiday i prefer to go to the other countries for travelling
i spend most of time with my mother i love to stay with my mother she is my icon actually
all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies about this topic i think the advantages is that it can promote the independence of the students to live up by themselves but the disadvantages are that students do n't have time to focus on their studies so it maybe influence the result of their academic performance
so here are several steps you need to do when you 're travelling by airplane first you can travel to the airport by any transportation you like after arrived in the air port you should check in first and then go through the document control after the security permission you need to wait for the plane arrive after that you can board in the airplane and then you just wait for the plane to take off
i think students can use computer and to surfer on the internet to learn some topics they are interested in that will be very effective
well it depends that will be it
by doing group projects people can learn a lot of new knowledge and new way of thinking from the other students and that 's a very good model for their learning
in my opinion go to the classroom and attending the lectures is more effective than reading alone at home because if you come across some problem you can raise your hand and ask questions immediately
i think it 's very important for a university to provide modern high advanced technology for learning facilities because students can very effectively learn some new knowledge
when i am on my holiday i enjoy travelling other countries and do something i 've never done
the job i would like to have in the future is flexible and which i can aim at my pace
and disadvantages they ca n't concentrate on their future studies so in my opinion they can have it both but they should concentrate on studies than working
i will explain how to process when you travel by airplane firstly you should travel to airport by yourself by your car by bus or by tube then you should check in with your flight staff and you should submit your passport valid passport to document control staff and also you should be checked by security guard you wait till you board your airplane and that 's it
well some people say face to face learning is very effective
i think attending lecture is important as much as reading a book by yourself
well providing modern learning facilities from university is not so important for me because you can study anywhere everywhere
well it 's a difficult question to answer because i love christmas and summer but if i have to choose between one of them i would say summer and i think that for several reasons because when summer i am on vacation so i spend a lot of time on the beach and with my family
to tell you the truth it 's super important in fact when i wake up in the morning and i go to the office i try to listen to the radio every day and always i try to find newspapers as well as i trying to use twitter for us
well when i was a child i used to go to the beach given that i spent a lot of time with my cousins who were living in another city and with my grandparents let 's say that it was the perfect moment to have all the family close and to spend a lot of time with them
that 's a difficult question to answer i would like to know it but i would like to work in an embassy or consulate i 'm striving to improve my english to get this job i hope everything work out well for me
to begin with this question i would like to shed light on the fact that everyone should work a little while as you are a student if we talk about the advantages i would say that you 're going to earn a salary you are going to learn experience and trust me when i say that this is something crucial if we talk about the disadvantages i would say that maybe you will have to spend a lot of time working and for this reason maybe you fail in your degrees to speak well not to fail but at least to maybe you will have less grade as far as i am concerned i would say that this is an experience that i recommend to everyone it should be mandatory if you are studying a degree because i would say that it 's quite important to get experience in a job
as we can see there is a comparation between different thousand of peoples and different days it 's paramount to draw special attention to the fact that tunes net began to hit rock bottom however it 's going up right now and it 's at the most senior level however if we speak about music now and songs four you they were at the upside of the present leader
this is something that is on everyone 's list but if i have to say something i would say that a person who understand everyone and support their team you know not is a person who want to show off or something like that someone who works as a team
well that 's a difficult question to answer because as you know when you are in a small team there are different people and maybe the communication is something good
yes sure why not but i should say that if it is always in a polite way for example it 's nothing bad if you disagree on someone because for example that mean that you are thinking about how to improve your team
we live in a world that is very competitive and we have technology as a tool for these type of teams to work as a teams but i prefer to work face to face it 's more effective
well it 's difficult to answer this question because i should give a special attention to the fact that it depends on the person you are or the people who integrate your team for example if you are working with people who are super lazy obviously is better to work alone
actually i do consider myself an environmentalist because i care about the sustainability develops of cities
i would like to say we love enjoy time together reading for example but the truth is we enjoy hanging out going to bars having drinks and maybe stay in at night at home watching movies
probably the people who i get along the most is my mom because she and i have a lot of things in common we two enjoy having our time together watching movies or t v show hanging around
i do n't have problems actually living here or there now i 'm living in a malaga which is a city located by the sea so i would love to live here because of the weather
i do consider one of the advantages of giving free time to students for doing fitness classes will help students to lose their anxiety and lower their levels of stress
after collecting them the bees go to the beehives where they produce the honey after that there are some workers which are specialise on collecting honey from these beehives all the honey collected are put in some jars and then they are to deliver to the supermarkets there actually are different kinds of honey coming from different types of species of bees in nature
students actually consider many things as they choose some country for live in
studying a second language has a lot of advantages and one of them it 's letting people to travel and known a different kind of culture and make them independent to live in another place and grow as a person
living in another country and learning and studying there it 's something that only students that are privileged can do that
about the place where i live i can tell you that it 's a comfortable city not big not small you have plenty of things to do everything is near so that you do n't have to do big trips big travels
while i 'm on holiday i enjoy trying new things new places new food obviously if i 'm visiting a country abroad but if i can enjoy it with friends and good company that would be the key for me if i 'm doing my holidays
i spend time with everyone i enjoy spending time with every single member of my family but i have to say that when i spend time with my sister i really enjoy it just because i do n't have that much time to spend with her usually so yeah i really enjoy it
i do n't know yet i think it 's too early for me to know where i want to be in the future where i want to work at so i have to think of it but i think as long as i have a comfortable job with good people around me that would be a good place to work
talking about the advantages and disadvantages of students getting jobs to pay their university studies i should say that as advantages those would be for example they would gain experience and they will learn values such as hard work and discipline in order to accomplish something in talking about on the other hand on disadvantages i think that at those ages they should focus on studying and just be focused on what they want to be and to become what they want to be in the future so in my opinion i do n't think that students should get jobs in order to pay universities because they should be free for me or have a less cost and being everyone capable of getting to university
in order to travel by plane you have to follow several steps until you finally get into the plane first of all you have to travel to the airport i recommend you to travel by an hour and a half or two hours before you have the travel secondly is very important to do the check in once you get to the airport before you pass several controls such as document control or security control once you 've completed all these stages which are very important in the whole process you will have your time to wait until boarding so after all those steps you just have to board into the plane and enjoy your trip so i would say those are the main steps
i think students can use technology for using other platforms or other options rather than books to study and being connected with people to share knowledge and notes so i think that 's very helpful
i think obviously is a better option to learn face to face with a professor or a teacher you get a different perspective it 's more direct form so yeah i think it 's better in so many ways
i think the most important skill that a student can learn from group projects are to hear people listen to people and learn from it obviously another ones are sharing thoughts and respect from your teammates
of course is more useful attending lectures you listen to a professional as your teacher and you have the option of listening doubts from other students you interact with them
i think it 's so important to have good facilities such as a library a good places for studying for students they get more involved in the university they experience the university in another different way
i am very interested in environment i usually recycle all kinds of products at home in order to get a better world in the future
well years ago when i was younger we used to play football all together but in these days we tend to go for a run
i am extremely similar to my mother not only physically but the personality as well i can understand my mother
well i really do n't mind i just want to be happy the place where i am going to live is not important for me but i guess that i would prefer living in spain my country
students are usually fat in these days not only in spain but around the whole world so i think it 's essential to the schools to make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes i can only see advantages in that way maybe one of the disadvantage is the smell after doing fitness classes because there are not showers in the spanish schools so it can be a problem
everybody likes honey but where is it come from well first of all the animal called bee is collecting nectar from flowers after that bees make honey from nectar in beehives then the human being the professional has to collect honey from beehives in the more natural way as possible after that honey is almost ready to be eaten
well i think that more knowledge you have or skills you have then more easily you will get a job in the future so it 's crucial to study in a second language
in my humble opinion it wo n't be easy in the beginning
speaking from my own experience i learnt a lot of local culture when i was studying in england
i could n't agree more with that studying abroad is essential in order to become independent
i enjoy learning about other countries specially about its culture its language its history it 's quite interesting for me
on my leisure time i like to do yoga or to tailor i am fascinated in fashion and tailoring
i guess there are a lot of way to improve my english for example i am studying all on speak and improve and on write and improve
honestly i 'm not very good in establishing a rapport with other people i 'm an introvert and i 'd like to be more extrovert show i 'd like to have such a skill as small talk
i think that working part time while studying helps us to be more organised to be more autonomous and it also helps us to practice in what are we studying i mean that we have an opportunity to experience what are we studying and do something what we studied about and as for disadvantages i think that of course it takes time and you have less time for studying and for your assignments from university
now i 'd like to tell you about acid rain about its reasons about process of its formation and about consequences of acid rain first of all a lot of factories on our planet makes a lot of pollutions then these pollutions are with the smoke raised to the air and the wind it fly to clouds and it compound with clouds and then it fall with rain or snow into our forests and lawns
well it 's a tricky question but first of all eat less ready made meal and eat more home prepared meal and no fast food and junk food
i heard that everybody should drink enough water and i heard the good amount is about two or three liters of water but as for me i ca n't drink so much water
as for my opinion i think that it 's of vital importance to do exercise every morning or every evening if you want to have a healthy lifestyle
i 'm not sure about eight hours of sleeping but i can agree that it 's very important to have enough sleeping for some people it can be just six or seven hours
i think it have both positive and negative effects and you should remember about digital hygienic and you should spend less times with your gadgets
i like to travel a lot and know different culture
i am trying to attend courses online and reading many english books
it will be how to play tennis
from my opinion it 's good for a university student to do part time because it gets many advantage to them like acquire new experience make a new friends but another advantage is that they learn how to be independent person
the acid rain happened when the smoke from factory came up until reach the sky then other acid particles mix with cloud water after that acid particles are in the rain or snow
for eating the habits it 's preferable to eat three times per day and must be healthy food including vegetables meat and low carbohydrate
drinking a lot of water to keep body hydration and allow you to feel fresh every moment
it is not essential to do exercise every day but at least three times per week and the duration for each one must be an hour
technology have a positive and a negative effective for positive effective it allows them to read a lot of books through internet
i 'd like to learn about other countries and their cultures because its open a new window a new vision to me
i like to listen to music watch movies design user interface or just walking
the best way to improve my english is to speak with someone like a native speaker or someone has skill enough to talk me back
definitely it 's programming or web development
working for students have some advantages and disadvantages some of its advantages is the work give them experience in some field and also it makes them ready to work in future however it has some disadvantages maybe its effect on study because it makes them tired and there is no energy to study and finally my suggestion is that the university must have some jobs for a student in a relative field that they study
there are lots of reason that make acid rain but a majority of that come from factories ' smoke and also vehicles ' pollution first of first pollution from factors and vehicles come to the air and acid particles combined in a cloud or some of them fall as a dust after a while cloud make rain and acid particles are in rain or snow falling to the trees and ground
i think they have to eat each meals in that specific time and also they have to prevent to eating junk foods and eating healthy food instead of that
human have to drink at least eight glass of water every day
i think that 's right because if your body ca n't rest and working hour and hour it makes it tired and exhausted for next day
some of technology helps people to get slim and healthy but some of them not
i want to know about other countries i want to learn about their history their customs their cooking and other things that they do during the day
i enjoy very much my free time reading books learning about other countries learning about other languages for example english cooking and doing watercolours painting
i watch many videos for improving my listening and this help me to improve my speaking also the web is the most important thing to improve my speak english

working during university years can cut both ways many students have the advantage to earn extra money for their personal stuffs also can acquire work experiences that will help them in the future what they have to concentrate in their study course as a first thing to achieve unfortunately some students quit their university after start working and earn money for other students is impossible to work and study and the same time because of the time consuming for both tasks i believe that is very personal to each student and his circumstances work and study is the ideal way but no many students can accomplish it

i enjoy my free time watching the movies staying at home doing houseworks walking around going to gym and eating healthy food
for me the best way to improve my english is to have someone to correct me and give me pieces of advice
advantages are like they get or get to know how the people behave through the society and disadvantages are that they need to do other things while they need to study they need more time to study and what is my own opinion is that every single student need to put an effort throughout his or her studies
so there are factories and vehicles that are located mainly in the city and they are very dramatic
the main advice that i can give them is to select the times that they need to eat at least they should eat five times per day choosing very quality of food too
to drink a lot of water it 's so important for our healthy because so we need to oxygenate our body and at least we should drink like two litres
not every day but we need to do exercise at least three times a half hour per week

nowadays all university students do part time job while they studying there are some advantages and some disadvantages however there are some disadvantages as you know many student they spend a lot of time doing part time job so they ca n't finished their courses many of them failed and so it 's very bad for their future when they ca n't get degree in my opinion students should balance between working doing part time job and studying because study is more important and they need to spend more time for their studying
acid rains is a very serious problem nowaday in many country and they flies around some of them to fall at dust but other still fly and they mix with clouds water and then they many acid particle in the rain as snow
they should try to avoid eating snack and a lots of foods with a lots of oil and red meat is not good for the health they shoulds eats more vegetable and fruits
drinking water is very important for our body is not good for the health they shoulds drink clean water
i think that s i completely agree with the idea that peoples should sleep at least eight hours every nights because sleeping is the time for us to relax and release stress also we are to have time to recharge energy after working very hard
on the roads technology change our life there are lots of positive effects on our life but also have some negative effects on our heath
it 's a very nice place where it has a lot of fishermen and it 's just by the sea it 's amazing
well when i 'm on holiday i usually like to visit places where i can you know know about the countries about the culture about the people so i like you know to walk around and visit a lot and i also like to go to the beach and just wandering out and about
i would say the advantages of having a job during the time in uni is that you are being able to earn your own money getting a life experience you know getting to know different people i believe a disadvantage will be you know managing the time between the studies and the time for work that could be a problem but at the same time that could be a lesson as well you can learn from it so in my opinion i think it 's always a positive experience to get a job during the university time you can always learn something about it
in first place to travel by airplane you need to get to an airport you can get there by car by bus or you can take the train airplanes get permission to take off and landing by the control tower once you 're at the airport you have to look for the check in to check your tickets and to drop off your luggage from there you go to document control they will check your passport and then you 'll have security that will check your hand luggage then you can sit and wait to be called for boarding
well they can use technology through computers computers and internet they can research everything they want online and they can use the computer to write everything they have documents
i think nowadays that 's been proven wrong we have a situation that we really understand now that if we do courses online they are as good as doing face to face face to face is good but online is also possible
well they can learn how to listen to each other they can learn about creativity they can be more open minded they can learn how to discuss
i think it is i think when you see someone talking about a subject is more effective because you pay more attention than reading with reading you can go back
it is very important nowadays students are used to a lot of technology and a lot of apps that do everything for them so if universities or schools do n't have what they have home they will feel very disappointed
i 'm not interesting too much but i think that is quite important because we do n't have other planet to live and the people has n't be aware about the important of environment i think
well before the situation of covid nineteen we liked to play football but after this situation we like to play video games and read books
i think that is my mother because i have the same personality that he has and maybe my friends say me that i have the same self appearance that he has
well i think that one of the advantages is that the fact that the students has to do an exercise to be healthy and so it 's so important i think that it is so important and one of the disadvantages i think that there is no one i think you have to do your workout and be healthy
well the picture shows a diagram of how the bees collect nectar from the flowers and in the foreground i see a bottle with honey i see too a person with a jacket maybe because if they do n't dress it the bees will sting him and that 's it
the price of the thing that they will be buy like a lot of food
i think that is quite important because they give you an opportunity to travel around the world for example in my case i can travel with my english to birmingham londres i think
i think that maybe the languages because if you do n't know about it is quite difficult learn it but if you control the language i think that it will be easier
well i think that they have a different ways one of them i think that is talk with other people go out there and buy something like that
yeah absolutely i think that if you go far away of your home you have to be independent because if not you maybe can die if you do n't cooked by yourself
well it 's really beautifuls and we have nice views of mountains and sea at night it 's windy so it 's nice to stay outside
yeah on holiday i enjoy staying at home and reading books but if the weather is fines i preferred going outside with my friends or family
i have to say that to be honest i enjoy spending my time with my sister because our age is not very different and i am nineteen years old and she is twenty one years old we are like friends and i can tell her everything i 'm very comfortable
to be an english language teacher it is the aim that i really wanted to be and also i want to do some educational business not only in my country but also in foreign countries
i agree with that from my opinion the advantages of getting jobs to pay for the university study are that they will be independent in the future and they will get working experience my opinion is it is really good to get a job but you must be flexible with your job and with your study this is time to work concentrate on your work when it 's time to study fully concentrate on your subject
ok first of all you have to travel to airport by taking a bus or subways whatever transportation that you like you can take and then you have to pass through document controls and also security and finally you have to wait
on this day because of pandemics we have to stay home it is the best time to make good use of technology you can study from online and you can also download some educational app and you can do some study
yes i agree that one it is best to teach face to face it is more affected but on this day unfortunately because of pandemics we have to stay at home and study from online so it is not very good for some people
and in the futures they can work with a lot of people in a company or in something
that 's a good question how can i say for me i prefers reading alone because i can not concentrate well while i i am attending lecturers but for some of my friends for them they prefers attending lecturers it depends on the learner
yes it 's important to have learning facilities fully because you know on the world most of the famous university in the world have good facilities for students and then the students ' work it can be learned more effectively
i could n't agree more with environmentalists i am such fan of greta thunberg and i also go to as many demonstrations as i can to show my support to this absolutely fair cause
well it may sound odd but i have no many friends i am devoted to my husband which is the person with whom i spend most of my free time only having nights in and watching the last netflix movie makes me happy i do n't need anything else
well maybe it 's a cliche but my mother is my mirror she 's the person who teach me all i know about love about life i love as she loves i am i as sympathetic as she is
definitely my choose would be miami u s a where i had the opportunity to spend three months as an intern of the spanish consulate a time in which i fell in love with the city i am eager to come back
should fitness classes be mandatory for every student in schools and college what are the advantage of this kind of measure what are the disadvantage and finally what i personally think well on weighting up pros and cons i must recognize that i consider these kind of initiatives are very useless no one can impose that on us it has to be our choice no one else
the production process of honey is a circle that starts when those little and annoying insects called bees collect nectar from flowers then honey is bottle and transported to be put on our supermarket premises for us to be able to enjoy it
choosing a country that is english native is a must have because going away has mainly an academic purpose and improving your english is something essential for your following professional career
studying in a second language not only in english it is also valid to study in spanish portuguese or french will make the most of your brain and increase your c i to make you more intelligent
becoming independent is a natural consequence of moving away from your parents ' home it does n't matter if you choose to do it within the borders of your country or abroad them the important fact is that you take the decision to fly away
my spare time is mainly reading books and watching t v with my parents and my family concurrently
obviously learn really really really fast as i think this could be really useful really help for me
i 'd like to say that university students it 's better that if they have some part time jobs as that could be really useful for their future and for their future professional degree or well for professional career i think that could be a advantages but there are plenty of disadvantages for instance they can be focus on their own degrees or their own studies for example so in my opinion i believe that it 's a double edge sword as they have to be really responsible
this drawing show us the cycle of the acid rain that is damage to the environment so also these acid rains could be really really hurt and damage for all of us people do not nothing
it 's quite important as you might need to around two or three litres for be hydratate
i believe that every day no
i think that 's depend on what if you do too much exercise in your every day or not but it 's depend on you and what do you thinks you do
technology has always been incredible thing for us like the gadgets with for instance ipads
i am quite interesting on it because it 's allowed me to enrich my knowledge about other people around the world and it can make me more sage in the future and it provides me or an open mind
generally speaking i like going around with my friends having some walk and so and i also like to drink some beer or coffee while we are talking about our daily life or daily problems well it 's useful
well the better way to improve english is practicing a lot and especially when you have the chance to speak a lot with other people so that you can check if you are understood do you know and that 's quite important
i 've always liked to know how to cook because it is very important it 's essential for make a living having notions about how to prepare your own meals so for me it would be vital for my life
well it 's a good thing that students do a part time job while they are a student because the benefits it 's that they can save money for their expenses such as food clothes travellings the tickets for commuting and so on but in conclusion from my point of view it 's a perfect method to start to be financially independent from your parents as well as you have the chance to organise your time to combined work and studying so it 's a good way to become independent and mature
it is obvious that we must to end with the pollution in our cities this is because they are producing acid rain this is caused with the acid particles in smoke which is carried by the wind and some acid particles fall as dust and others with the clouds ' water that provokes that acid particle fall down in the ground and that affect to the growing of the greenery and that affects to the human population as well
well one of the advices would be starting eating fruits and vegetable as much as possible and avoid having products with a high amount of sugar that is the main point
yes at least thirty minute walking can work for you have a better life
yes i think it 's true almost the most as you need because it 's a moment where the body recover from any illnesses or damaging that they have had during the day so it 's quite important
depending on the device because if you have heart attacks there are devices that detect that problem easily so in medical devices there have improved a lot and it 's very important too
my town is small but it has bridge river lake and mountain
i enjoy doing nothing
we like jogging and watching documentaries
i would like work as a teacher
the disadvantage they having less time to study less time social time or to take a break
the first is travelling to airport you can travel with taxi car bus or train when i was arrived you will check in your gate then you should be pass the document control and security after you can wait sitting in airport chairs in a restaurant in a bathroom or shopping when your airplane be ready you will board
they can use their p c for study to take notes or to search on internet
i do n't like to study face to face because i am shy
they can develop they patience and they learn how to treat with other people
if people need learning facilities they should have them
i have to admit that i am interested in the environment i 'm not really really really interested i 'm not really keen on environment but anyway i tried to read as many articles as possible every day on the news sites to be informed because i think this is a important matter in our current lives
we enjoy doing together different things but one of the things that we do most probably is to go out for a beer and not a couple of beer just to have yeah interesting or normal conversation about something serious thing
i have n't given much thought on that but i 'd say that in the future i see myself in the some country in the south america for example i 'd like to live in argentina at least for a few years
i think this is a good topic to talk about yeah thinking about advantages i think one of the main advantages is that if we permit our students to do fitness class yeah this is going to help them to develop a healthy lifestyle in the future about the disadvantages i say one of the main disadvantages would be that they probably would have less time to work on other subjects so we have to take that into consideration my opinion i think from my point of view i 'd say that we should all schools should schedule some some fitness lesson some fitness classes periodically
okay i 'm going to give a quick presentation about how honey yeah goes from flower to shop i think the first stage is that the bees collect nectar from flowers and then they will make honey from nectar in beehives after that beekeeper the man who are beeeepers collect honey from beehives and then this honey end up in the shelves of the shops
yeah i think students should consider many aspect many thing for example what language is spoken in that country even the country so far is too far from the origin country because sometime you want to get fly and can be very very expensive
when you study in a second language the main thing the main advantage is that you are going to learn other language
so try to be out as much as possible
yeah i totally agree with the people who think that because i think when you are alone in other countries and you have to face so many difficulties in every single day so it 's going to help you to become more independent yeah this is for sure
i live in seville and seville is the best city around the world it has a lot of culture issues for example the cathedral of seville and the giralda it 's amazing and the food is good
on holidays i used to go to the beach with my family but right now i am working in a swimming pool so i will not go with my family this year but i will go with my boyfriend on weekends
well in a future i will be a government person i mean i will like to have a government job and help people that need help at least economic help
well to have a part job at the same time that you are studying university could be really hard the advantages are that you could save money to spend on a good master when you finished your degree and you know what are your limits and the disadvantages are that you do n't have enough free time to spend with your family or your friend go out go to the cinema or go to the beach in my opinion this is really riching because you learn how to organisate yourself you need to know how time will you spread studying and how time are you working on your life
well travel in a plane could be complicated but its is easier than you think first of all you ca n't forget your passport and your documentation first you take a car a taxi or a bus to go to the airport one time that you are there you will do your check in with a person that will help you then you should wait a minute and you could go to the bathroom or take some coffee then you will board and it is all
well nowadays every company has a new technology and people have to adapt to the globalisation so this year technology was really important because of covid
well in a future students probably will need to work in groups so you will need to be a good teamworking in my opinion it is a great idea
that is how you will do your exam
in my opinion this is really really important for public schools and university because if they do n't have resources government should provide them
personally i 'm very interested in environment because there 's no planet b so we have to take care a lot of this because in the future our sons are going to live in the earth and we have to keep it the better we can together
i met most of my friends in the travel agency where i used to work so the thing that we really enjoy the most is travelling all together especially to mexico because we love the beaches over there and all the food and the traditions
i would say that i 'm very close to my mum because she 's the one who spends more time with me and we are also creating a business together so we do really enjoy doing the same things as for example producings this hand made jewellery brand
two years ago i had the opportunity to study abroad in the u s and there i discovered miami so i would say that miami it 's my kind of place where always there 's good weather and many plans to do so definitely i would love to live there in the future
when talking about introducing fitness classes at schools i would say that there are more advantages than disadvantages for it because it is undeniable that getting to do exercises at least thirty minutes a day it helps to be in a better shape and to be healthier in the future so i would say that these are the main advantages on the other hand the disadvantages it 's that they will take a lot of time out of the students to get ready for it and then shower after doing those fitness classes
so today we are going to go through the whole process from how the honey goes from a flower to the shop so firstly the bees are collecting the nectar from the flowers especially during the spring they are making that honey nectar in their beehives which there are their homes so once the bee collectors are staring at those beehives and see that there 's a bunch of honey they collect it and they send it to the manufacturing companies that they actually put it into individual recipients and after that those companies are the ones that transport it and sell it to the stores that then we are able to get it from there when we go to the supermarkets
based on my personal experience a candidate that is trying to choose a country where to study abroad the first thing that they have to take into account is the language because otherwise it is going to be very difficult for them to follow all the classes and to be integrated in the classroom
so the benefits of studying in a second language they are very clear because you get to know more people and you are able to travel by yourself to more countries where you are going to have more possibilities to express yourself to other people
i think that there are many barriers that you could face when studying in another country for instance not only the language itself because you can learn that but the traditions and the culture in there at the very beginning can be very shocking for a foreign student
when you are abroad you have to really learn the local culture by hanging out with locals if you just keep hanging out with the international people you are not going to be immerse in that and it is not going to be as beneficial as possible
personally i totally agree with that statement because for many people when you study abroad it is the first time becoming independent without your parents and you learn how to actually manage all your economy your house and all doing the groceries and everything
i 'm from cadiz but i live in granada because i studying there granada is a fantastic city but the unique problem is has n't got beach
holiday i love to go to the beach go out with my friend go to the party with my friend visit my friend from other cities
he has three years more than me and i like do sport with he
i am studying psychologies and in the future i would like to be a neuropsychologist because i like the different neuropathologies
advantages is that you can be more responsible and the disadvantages is time is more difficult work and study but in my opinion all students should work and study at the same time in the last year of their degree
when you travelling by plane the first thing is travel to airport you can travel by car by bus or by train when you arrive to the airport the first thing that you have to do is the check in and then you have to pass and show your document control and pass the security control then after that you can wait taking a coffee go to the shopping go to the toilet at the time of your plane you board in the plane and then your fly start
i do n't agree with this because for example there are a lot of degrees and master onlines and in my opinion i think that 's there are a good option to study
for working in group project i think that is important the organisation is important to listen to your partner
i am living with my family with two siblings and my grandparents the place where i live is three storey building and a small garden in front of it
actually i do a lot of activity on holiday i usually spend some quality of time with my friends and family i occasionally visit some places which is in my city and i seldom play cricket and volleyball with my friends
is no doubting my brother he is my elder brother and he is quite funny and sometime we spend a lot of time together we enjoy the dinner together we enjoy to talking and some sharing information with each other and i usually play cricket with him a lot
so in the future i want to be a computer engineer well i have completed my bachelor 's right now so i want to be a good programmer i guess in the future and it is very helpful for me to build my career
there are many advantages when a student get a jobs to pay for their university studies to begin with if student do a job while is studying at university he will be very independent from their parents so it is very advantages for them apart from them also he get and widen their knowledge in different fields well there are also several disadvantages to be doing a part time job during their university studies first of all they can not cop out with their studies because like find maybe difficulty with their course and it might be getting hard in their exam situation so may have been some time student may have failed
now i 'm gon na talk about how to travelling by plane and all the processes required to do at airports first of all individual have to travel by car taxi or bus or train to the airport after that they have to provide their passport and some documents so that airport authority will verify you and then individual have to pass from security process and then wait for their flight so when flight is arrived you will be notified by the authority of airport and then you have to find your seat in airport according to your tickets and then flight will take off from the you know airport
students nowadays use technology in various ways apart from that they can you know gathering information from various sources through the internet it will be very helpful for them in study
to my perspective face to face studying is quite beneficial for student as is a teacher can notice the behaviour of student and they can find some mistake of a student so and also give some wise advice how to improve that mistakes
various skills students can improve by studying and working in a group the sense of communication is increasing while work in group
my perspective attending lecture is quite interesting rather than reading alone in contrast whenever you read alone you can you know you yourself find boring what in contrast whenever you attending a lecture you can interact with your peers as well as your teacher so it may be beneficial
and so that student can learn more and they can get a better job in the future
well the place where i live is a small city in the south east of spain what i most like is that people are very friendly and there are a very good environment in the streets
due to my work i do n't have lot of holidays but any case what i most like doing is to travel abroad with my family in order to improve my knowledge about other culture and customs
the person who i most enjoy spend my time is my son because he is so lovely
in the future i would like to continue working as a teacher at the university because i really love these jobs
in one hand if you work while you are studying you have the opportunity to have money for travel and do another things apart from be focus on your studies on the contrary you spend time working you have less time for study perhap your academical result could be less satisfactory than you expect
the first step is to travel to the airport in your own car or by public transport once you are in the airport you have to go to the check in table and present your identification and leave your baggage there after obtain your board card you have to pass the security control but before you have to show your indification once you having done the security step you can wait in the restaurants and after that you can board and take off
working in group projects you can develop mainly skill related with the collaboration the self confident organisation of the work
they must provide facilities in order to be with date
well i live in madrid it is a really big and huge city it is known because of a high population of chinese people so it 's like the chinatown of madrid so we have a lot of multiculturality in our neighborhood
well i really like to relax and to not think about my work or study or anything so i really like to watch series and t v shows just hanging out with my friends going to the swimming pool or even to the beach if i can reading books and just have time for myself spend time for myself
i like spending time with my sister because she is like four years older than me and we look alike we 're very similar in personality and in hobbies so i really like spending time with her speaking about anything that happens in our daily life because she does n't live with me anymore
well i 'm preparing myself for being a scientist so i would really like do science and i am looking for a p h d position in something related with neuroscience and i would really like to research and just find something that could help people with neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimer
i think the good things about working while you are studying in university is that you can earn your own money so it makes you realise how important and difficult is to get your own money and sustain yourself i also think that helps you develop skills like social skills and working under pressure although i think that it is right actually really complicated to work while you are studying possibly or probably your marks are going to go down you are not going to get as good marks as you might be able to and you will have to spend less time meeting your friends and doing stuff you like in my personal opinion no one should be obligated to do it only if you want to do it i think government should pay the tuition
the first thing you have to do is get to the airport you can do it using different transport you can go by car by bus or by train there are different things and also you can take a taxi or any other private transport once you get there you will have to check in you will have to show your ticket and your identification card and go to the document control depending on the place you 're gon na go you will need to do it even twice afterwards you have to go through security afterwards you have to wait until you can get into the plane and you will board you will sit in the plane and you 're just ready to enjoy your flight
there are different ways to use technology in order to better study for example you can watch many youtube videos that help you out a lot for example in mathematics i think you can use it in different resources in my case for example i 'm a biologist and i really need to read papers and internet is a way
i absolutely agree with a idea i think that teachers are really important well they can explain to you exactly to you just for you and you can ask them anything so it 's really helps you learn
yeah i think so and there is much information you get and it 's sometimes easier to understand stuff if someone explains to you talking not just reading
it is really important nowadays teachers uses slides to explain stuff you also need laptops and university should give you laptops if you do n't have your own laptop and your library should be modern enough you have to have your catalog in internet
i have a lot of forest and parks with lagoons so i really like it all the nature where i have around myself but is a beautiful place
and that 's my life
not only is my mum but also is my sister she are all for me so i really love her and my sister too
i really would like to be an animator in disney or dreamworks industries i have a lot of possibilities in the arts
for that reason we can be a graduated student but we really need to understand that one of the disvantage are the accumulation about topics subjects and assignments when we are in the jobs so please focus on what is more important so you can get job and pay later your university
later you need to go at the station and you need to check in at web page when it 's time to you board to the plane you need to board and take off the plane
the students use technology principally to focus and investigate some topics some new topics idioms watch videos about one thing and write and do their homework
the subjects could be ethics a lot of justice arts in this case they can improve their abilities about the art communication and give out some score and feedback about something
all depends about the student someone would be better with the alone reading other it 's better attending lectures but it 's all depends about the student and their best way to study
what i mean is this twenty one century is the age of the technology
the place where i live is a little town next to the sea in costa brava is a little village and it 's so cool to live there because there are n't so much people and it 's very quiet
the thing that i most enjoy when i 'm on holiday is going to the beach and swimming in the sea and hanging out with my friends sleep until very late and basically doing nothing
i could n't choose between my mother and my father i love them both and i love enjoying my time with both of them
in the future i will be a teacher and i am studying at university to reach my dream
i am an university student and i see the reality of this topic the advantages are that you will learn experience and also money but there are a lot of disvantages for example in my case i could n't work and study at the same times because university it takes all my time i have lot to works a lot to study and it 's impossible for me to work and also there 's a lot of people like me that they can complaining the study and the work in my opinion is this if you study you study and if you work you work
this is a summary of how is travelling by airplane at first place you have to go to the airport you can use a car and bus a train a taxi once you 're there you have to go to the terminal and after that you have to go on the check in they will check your luggage after that you have to show your i d identification and after that you go to security they will check that you bag is safety and then when you pass the security you will have to wait until it 's time to boarding the plane and when you board the plane then you can go
they can use technology in some different ways with the computers and tablets we have a lot of information and we can use the internet to make all the work in all the studies that we need
in my opinion i prefer to attend to a face to face class because i think i can focus more on what the teachers is saying and i can take better notes
working on group projects is a good way to work because it has a lot of benefits for everyone in the group we learn to split the task we learn to work together and cooperating and i think it 's very useful
well i think that attending to lectures is worse than reading for your own because you are not as focused as if you were who is reading and that 's why i think it 's better reading for your own
for the universities the learning facilities are a basic thing they have to provide a good learning facilities for the students so they can make their degree effectively
i like playing the trumpet with my father or with the band on friday on sunday i like staying with my family at home
i think the best way is go abroad to england for example but it 's very difficult for me because i do n't have enough money however i think the best option is study in a english academy
so i think i could work about that
on the one hand you can earn money if you work no and you can help your parents because they are who pay all the studies no on the other hand is very difficult studying and working at the same time this perjudicate our studies is difficult to pass with a high mark in all cases
and some of them fall down to the forests and lakes the sea other particle mix with the water and when it 's raining or snowing these particle fall down to the earth
i recommend other people to eat as health food for example vegetables salad because the fast food is bad for us
is very important because our body need this water all food have water and the expert recommend us to drink one litre a day
in my opinion is very important
i think is positive for example the social network can show different health habit eh
i live in a small town that is surrounded to nature and you have many hiking routes to do in the town
when i 'm on holidays i enjoy to hang out with friends also to spend time with my family that is not near to me during the whole year and i also like to travel to and discover new places that i do n't know
i really enjoy to spend time with my sister because she does n't live with me and i really like being with her and spending quality time with her because she 's a very important person in my life and i really love to have time with her
i would like to be a hotel manager but i do n't know if it is going to be possible but i am going to work on a tourist company because this is what i studied and it is the thing that i want to work in
in my opinion students have to work to pay their university studies if their families do n't have the enough resources to affront that cost but i think if they have the support the economic support of their families they should not work because i think that the advantage of work to pay the studies is that you have an economy independence and you do n't have to depend on your parents but it is going to take you many time that you must be studying or many rest time that you need to have energy and to improve and to have good results on your studies on your university studies
so this graph shows us the different steps that you have to follow to travel by airplane as we can see the first step is that you have to travel to the airport you can do it by car by train or by bus then you have to do the check in on your travel company and this is the first step then the next step is that you have to pass the document control with the police and then you have to pass the security control where they are going to check your luggage then you have to wait before the boarding time in the airport you have many things to do like shopping have a coffee have a lunch and then you can board to the plane
i think that the students search on internet to many different articles that can help us to improve their learning
i think that learning face to face with a teacher is the best way to learn because you have the person in front of you to ask her or him all the questions that you have and they can help you with your issues
for me it works better reading alone because i prefer to be myself with my thoughts i prefer this way of reading than attending to a tour of lectures where they can distract you i do n't know for me it 's better read alone
and i think that is very helpful
the place where i live is quiet and there 's not a lot of people so you can sleep well here there is a lot of nature it 's a village it 's not a city so that 's it
when i 'm on holiday i love to go to the swimming pool and swim and be with my friends there if it 's raining i like to do other things like stay at home watching netflix watching series
i like to spend time with my brother my brother is one year old more than me so we 're very friends we spend all the time together we do a lot of things like we go running we go swimming and we go climbing
so i would train them i guess
if students worked to pay their studies they would be more independent from they parents and also they would be more preparated for the real life because things have to be paid off and disadvantages i would say the time for studying is less so they might have worse marks in their degree so my opinion is that parents should support their children to pay their studies because everyone not everyone but the majority of people want to study and have a future you know so i would say no
okay to travel by airplane you need tickets very important and some taxi or car or some friend who can take us to the airport and legal documents such as i d or passport okay we will travel to the airport first and then we 're in the airport we pass through the check in they will check all our documents of our ticket when they call us board and then the plane will take off with us
i think it 's not maybe if you go to a lecture and you do n't understand what 's explaining and you are not motivated it 's more useful to read and understand by yourself
it is very important to have good facilities such as a computer a fast computer but definitely is not the most important for students i would say the most important is how they teach and not what they have to teach you know
i am very interesting
when i have free time i go to the kitchen to make a sandwich or i watch t v or watch videos or watch tiktok
i practice my english with an app talking with outsiders
i want to be more flexible
the advantage that they can have is to learn more about the subject and do a good job the disadvantage may be that you work at some things that had already done
second acid particles in smoke three acid particles are carried by the wind four some acid particles fall as dust five other acid particles mix with cloud water and six acid particles are in rain or snow
when we drinking water our skin is very very beautiful and our health is so important
it 's very important to sleep eight hours every night because our body will be very tired
i am very interested because i am a biologist i studied the animals the plants all things that are relation with environment
i usually go to a bar or to a restaurant in the weekend
probably i think that my mother because her character is like me is a shy people but work a lot
i want to live in madrid because is a big city and you have a lot of possibilities to work in my field that is science
i think that the best or the worst disadvantage is that you have less time to study other subjects like science that i think it 's very important today
okay the honey prodution starts with the bees obviously because the bees collect nectar from flowers then the next step is when the bees make honey from nectar in beehives it 's a easy cycle to understand because all of us know how bees do the honey it 's a simple cycle
i think that the cost of the life the cost is very expensive you probably would n't go to this place and the near of your natural country and other things
if you know other language you can go other countries you can i speak with people from other culture and it 's better for your curriculum because you probably could obtain better work in the future
i think that the best difficult is the culture because if you go to other country you will find different situations on your life like if you want to take the bus it 's different
i think that it is necessary go out to a bar to a restaurant to a supermarket to a library to a museum it 's speak with the people of this country could have that you learn about this culture
of course because you need for example open a bank account
my favourite time of the year is springtime because everything is blooming the flowers are very nice i think the nature is awake the birds are chirping and yeah i think everything is very very wonderful outside marvelous
it is pretty important because i think if you would like to be well informed about the world
oh good question i do n't really know i 'd like to buy a detached house and move there together with my family members it would be a good idea i think because i am mother of two and for my children a garden would be great i guess but it is not feasible at the moment and i 'd like to teach english later
as for me i would say that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience because there would be so many benefits beneficial effects of it and i think it would be a good idea for the future employer and for him or her as an employee the disadvantages yam maybe if the student knows about the work in a more detailed way it would hinder him or her to do that kind of job later but all in all i would say that it would be a really brilliant idea to be in one of these courses
in this chart i can see the number of people who are interested in online pop music sites the red line depicts a kind of upward trend as far as those listeners are concerned who will listen to tunes net and as far as songs four you is concerned we can see a downward tendency because the number of listeners basically has dropped significantly and as far as music now site is concerned there is a kind of stagnating phenomenon because basically the number of those people who listen to this channel is basically stagnate
well this is an interesting question i think a good team leader should be ambitious should have expertise in the field where he or she works in my opinion he should be a good collaborative worker
this is a brilliant question maybe the problem can be that there is too much workload on each member and they can feel a strenuous after a tiring working day it must be very difficult to divide equally the tasks
i do n't think so in my opinion for that collaboration and agreement is highly needed deliberately needed
this is a pretty good question in my opinion it can depend on the situation the type of the work the type of the company where the employees are basically employed so it depends but sometimes face to face situation is definitely needed it depends on the type of the problem
teams can function better than working alone however it depends on the type of the persons who are in the team
but while it 's a good city to spend time but in summer it 's so so hot
i like to spend my free time with my mates in pubs or house of my friends for example i used do the computer game for example i would like to have more time
if you ask me i would select my sister because she 's of a similar age than me so we have the same interests and we have a good communication too so i would select my sister
while on the other hand the main disadvantage is the time that they must spend spending time for studying is a problem because in general terms they have n't a lot of time
okay regarding the question you must follow this instruction first obviously you must travel to airport in a personal car bus train or something similar ok other possibilities at this point in the airport you must check in and the assistant will be useful for you also you must speak with security personnel and document control personnel and well in this point after all you must wait which is desperating but you will have to do anyway so finally you can board the plane before the plane take off the ground and well good trip where to
technology is without doubt a revolution to way to study also technology is dangerous and it 's a part of distracting for the student
with the choose i would select probably books
regarding the question no in my opinion attending lecture are n't better option than reading alone
i 'm not really interested in learning about other countries although i think it could be interesting
i enjoy spending my free time by playing video games with my friends or listening to some music
the best way for me to improve my english is by watching netflix films or series
if i could learn to do something new i would like to learn cooking because i really like eating
some of the advantages that you can have by doing a part time job while studying is that you can start earning some money and one of the disadvantages it has is that you can get disconcentrated from doing other things other important things and in my opinion is that although you can get disconcentrated from school and important things it is a good thing since you are experimenting new things in your life
acid rain is formed when vehicles and factories produce pollution which makes acid particles in the smoke which then are carried by the wind and some of them fall as dust while others mix with cloud water which then fall in the form of rain or snow damaging the environment causing acid rain
they should think about which nutrients are the best for their body and can maintain them in shape
it is important for conserving energy and maintaining hydrated the body
i think it 's not an essential thing as long as you have good eating habits and you drink a lot of water
well it is proved that this is the most optimum time for us to rest and sleep so i think people should have a really controlled sleep schedule
i think it has had a bad impact on people since they have stopped paying attention to lot of important things and they just see social media
it 's a very peaceful and quiet place and all of his people meet themselves and are family or friends
when i am on holidays i love to swim at the sea and play volleyball on the beach with my friends yes
i always dreamed to work in the future to a social educator yes because i love help people
well let 's have a look okay one of the advantages of this is that the students could study at the university and other advantages is that yes if the students study at the university they will get a good work in the future well one of disadvantages is the students have less time to study and they maybe do n't can hang out with her friends in my opinion the university might be more cheaper
well first obviously you must go to the airport you can go on bus on train or in your car ok when you arrive to the airport you must pass the check in and the security control after that you must wait for the plane around two hours more or less and you can wait in the restaurant and you can go to the w c or cafe or shopping then you board to the plane and finally you relax and travel
students maybe can use the technology to study because there are some webs with a lot of information about different topics and students might find this interesting
in my opinion learning face to face with a teacher is a good way to learn
depends reading alone is so good to learn about a topic but attending lectures is other good thing for learn about
it 's too important that university gives to the students facilities like webs books dictionaries e t c
i 'm interested around my environment is clean and the temperature comfortable and that 's all
happy to do with my friend is going to karaoke
my mother is very similar to me
so this advantage is that all students has become improve because they are in this society so a lot of students do n't move their body but disadvantage so if they have a handicap so they can join the classes so they have bad things bad fears so my opinion is the college make the fitness classes because their health is more improve
so i will explain how to make honey so the six step to make the honey so from flower to shop the first one bees collect nectar from flower and the second step bees make money from nectar in beehives and the next step beekeepers collect honey from beehives and the honey move to the shop and selling
so studying in a second language 's advantage is they can talk a lot of people the another countries
the first step so before they move another country they have to search in the web
they 're becoming independent in other country because they have to do for themselves cleaning and the cooking or the speaking
i am fond of interest learning around different countries because it is significant for me it 's absolutely interesting for me
as i work a lot when i have a free time i try and have a rest i am fond of outdoor activities such as biking riding bicycles having fun walking
as for me the best way to improve my english is speaking constantly writing different essay reading various books and to listening various of podcasts
i am fond of interest in different literature and i like to do various research
i think yes all university students should do part time jobs because there are a lot of advantages of it they can earn their own money and they spend them that only they want
i think there are a lot of problems connected with factories and vehicles because factories produce a lot of harmful emissions also all vehicles produce a lot of carbon dioxide rmissions so in result we get pollution our ecosystem so this acid particles are in smoke and we smell this pollution and acid particles are carried by wind some acid particles will fall as dust other acid particles mix with cloud water and acid particles are in rain or snow so we are forced to smell this pollution
i think it is significant for every person to drink enough water during the day because we lose our water balance and we must to full ourselves with water
of course i think it is necessary for people to start every day with morning exercises it is not necessary to go to gym to do some exercises but it 's enough to do stretch and exercises
it depends on what side do you look of course there are advantages of using technologies in our life because various of apps related with our health and exercises can help you to keep healthy lifestyle
i am really interested in the environment because i am study marine environment organism and also i 'm conscient with problems in global warming
i have a lot of friends and i enjoying with them practicing some water sports
we are a lot of characteristics in commons and we are patients
i would like to live in the future in menorca because i think it 's a great place to have a child and also i have my family in that island
so nowaday almost all the college and schools dedicate part of her time to fitness classes and their consequence have some advantages and disadvantages the first advantage to do fitness classes is that the students could learn how practice or do some sport in their house also the disadvantages to doing fitness in classes is that some students did n't or could n't fall the rules and did n't take these classes seriously and then would be a waste of time for this kinds of students in my opinion it 's a great idea
so i gon na talk about an interesting process in which bees make honey and then we found in the supermarkets bees collect nectar from the flowers and it depends at the kind of flower that bees are looking the pollen could be one or other kind of honey there 're monofloral honey and based in multifloral components the bees transport the nectar to beehives and then they store it and the honey inside is the work of beekeepers to collect honey from the beehives and they have to take some cautions because the bees are a danger insects
so i think that learn a second language is very profitable in terms of cultural richness and also to earn more money it 's a great skill and could open a lot of windows in your work
so learn a new language is a very spend time and sometimes there are some cultural problems but i think that if you have a good attitude you can learn properly and will be a better person
the easiest way for study to know the culture of the country abroad is making local friends or speaking with natives they are who best could teach them their culture
so generally it is i am a student abroad and i have to say that i 'm more independent and i learn a lot of things that i could n't learn if i stay just at home so i totally agree
definitely my mother i like her i look like her and my personality is same as her personality and i love her so much
young people needs to do a lot of exercise so there are many benefits in do fitness classes at school or college because they can grow up health and active and there are some drawbacks we can say because they can hurt herself and sometimes maybe they can feel bad
well firstly bees collect nectar from flowers and transport this nectar from their beehives where make honey from nectar then beekeepers with an especial equipment to avoid bee chopped collect honey from beehives and after that they bottle up their honey the last is they transport their honey to the supermarkets to be sold
i mean it will be nearby their country to go back frequently
if you have the chance to travel abroad you can communicate with other people if you have a second language for example english english is used around the world so is really useful
if they do n't know well their language maybe they can find difficult to communicate if they have to go to the doctor or do any documents
it 's essential to know about the local country if you are living abroad because you know well what are their way to live there
the situation helps them to live independent without the parent
i reckon i 'm most similar to my mother we think as the same way and also people say that i look like her physically so yeah i look similar to her
well i like many countries including spain but i think if i have to choose one i will go to italy because it 's a country that i have ever seem like it 's the best country
while there are many advantages for example they can relax if they are so stressed because of studies i do n't consider that 's will have disadvantages but well if i have to say one i will say that students can become obsessed with sport we know that when they are teenagers they do n't feel so comfortable with their bodies so it will be dangerous if they become obsessed in my opinion sport is an essential activity for stay healthy so young people should practice it very often
we usually buy honey at shops but have you ever thought how is it produced well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and with this nectar bees make honey in their beehives then the beekeepers take the honey from the beehives and the next step is to put the honey in a receipt so as to be distribute in shops and finally the honey is in a stock so people can buy it
i think that i wo n't have any doubts choosing a country it will be italy since i was little i have always wanted to go there i do n't know why but i will choose it yeah
i think that it help us to travel around the world we can communicate with other people also we can find a job quickliers if we know how to speak another language
i believe that at first the most difficult thing is to get on with people however by the time you find it easy
i think that most easy way to learn about the culture is travelling around the local place so you can find many cultural landmarks
yes i totally agree because you are alone when you go abroad to study
so i live apart from where i 'm originally from so in my holiday i go back to my home to spend time with my family especially with my brother i play the video game just like once a year it 's like a competition and it is really fun
i told it to previous question however it 's going to be my little brother this is because i play the video game with him or you know we play the same sport baseball so we do a catch together and a lot of the time spending is really always fun
i would like to have the job of airline pilot this is because it was just my childhood dream since i was very little and also this is sometime calling the dream too so i think that 's what i want to be
i think that there are lots of pros and cons of getting a job to pay for their university studies one of the advantage is that you can get the job experience to explore what you are interested in and also try to figure out that what the student need in the future like specific skills and anything that the student can learn and also the disadvantage will be that the focus will be on the job not the study and in my opinion that the student should do a little bit of a job however they should mainly focus on their study in the university and in that way you can explore your interest
so nowadays a lot of people travel a lot so i will present about how to travel by the airplane we have three step after you got to the airport until you board to the airplane so once you get to the airport you have to check in yeah you have to check in your luggage and also give the clerk your identification and ticket and then you go through the document control and in the document control you have to show your passport and identification to check you are the right person to get in and also the final security and you get on board
i think the best thing about the technology on studying is that you do n't have to carry a lot of textbooks and notes i think if you got a ipad or something like the technologies you can take a note on that and also you can see the textbook on that
yeah i think the learning on like face to face is great but this is because that i can show the teacher the part that i do n't get it and teacher can focus on just teaching on that to me
this is because like the students will explain to each other about what you got and in that way the knowledge just stays in your mind
yes i think so too this is because you can understand where teacher 's just focused on by his or her tone of speaking and also the pace of speaking so yeah
really is a good question
a lot of things when i stay with my friends we usually go to journey to the mountains take photos and mainly stay together
if i have to choose one i choose my uncle because he loves photography and i love photography too and we speak a lot about that
if i could choose i would life with my brother in panama city because it 's a big city and wonderful city and i love it
as i see it the main advantage of do fitness classes at the schools and college it 's the health of their students regarding the disadvantage i reckon that they are less than the advantage the main disadvantage in my opinion it 's students ' tiredness i mean if they arrive tired to other classes their performance will go down as far as i 'm concern the fact of do any kind of exercise at the schools and college is good for the students and for the profession in general
honey from flower to shop the first part of the process is bees collecting nectar from flowers later bees make honey from the nectar in beehives and the beekeepers collected this honey in glasses or bottles of glass
let 's see at first time i think it 's a disadvantage because you ca n't understand anything but with the time you can understand a lot
when you 're a student in another country you can go to local places local clubs or a lot of things for know this culture
i agree with this statement because in my case i live with my parents and i do n't know how is live for my life alone like independent and it 's a disadvantage
i can get to the beach in only ten minutes on foot
i enjoy going do surfing i often go do surfing because my house is very close to the beach
i want to be a pilot because i can go to anywhere all around the world
i think there are two advantages for students first they can acquire new skills second they can manage themselves about their money on the other hand they spend less time studying this is a disadvantage for students i think students should not get jobs to pay for their university studies because it is important for students to study
i will give you a presentation about traveling by airplane first travel to airport you can get taxi or train or buses to airport you passed all this section you have to wait ten minutes you can go to cafe you can buy something in there you can get on plane
i think so too because it is important for studying something to ask some questions so it is important
they can acquire a skill to communicate with someone and can achieve together a same thing
i think so because attending lectures the teacher can give us a main point to study
ok i enjoy a lot of things when i am with my friends like go to the parties together watch the series or movies in english or spanish listen to music together in spanish or in english so i love spend time with my friends
i think that is my mum because my mona have a same qualities like me and i love my moma
i want to live to germany because one part of my family lives in this country and i love its culture its customs its people lives in this country and i love germany and i want to live in this country
hi everyone today i 'm going to talk about the schools and college should make time in the school day for all the students to do fitness classes i think that this topic it 's so very important because this one has a lot of advantage for example all the students increase your happiness increase your lifestyle and maybe increase a lot of things the principal increase your positive attitude increase your mental healthy your healthy lifestyle i think that is one that do n't have a disadvantage maybe i think that is no very stressful for the students and my opinion it 's so very important that all the students do the fitness classes every day and i think that is very important that the schools include this fitness classes i think those are very important
hi to everyone today i 'm going to talk about how honey is produced so the first step is the bees collect nectar from flowers so the second step is the bees make honey for nectar in beehives and the next step is the beekeepers collect honey for beehives i think that is very important
obviously it 's very difficult of studying in another country because you are away from your family
yes i think if you have the opportunity to study in another country you become into independent and i think that is very useful in your life
when i do n't have any obligation i 'm keen on watching series and films and also listening to music as i think it helps me to relax myself and another hobby that i have is cooking which i think i 'm really good at
actually with my mum as we have lots of things in common we both are adventurous we like to visit new places and also we love to train and do exercise so we have a really good time when we are together and i love her
as i 'm into ballet i hope i can spend the rest of my life practicing it so i wish i can join a company and become a professional dancer
in my opinion is great for students to take jobs as their parents wo n't have to pay for everything and it will be easier and cheaper for them also students can earn work experience and they will be more qualified when they finish college but the disadvantages are that they wo n't have much time left to study and that 's why they will have to be really well organised in order to be able to do both activities studying and working also this could be really really tiring in my opinion this would be an awesome experience for students and really helpful for their parents so it 's a really good option
hi everyone today i will explain which are all the things you need to do to travel by airplane first of all as you see in the first picture you need to travel to the airport and you can choose any mean of transport you want for example you can go by car by bus or by train then after you arrive there you 'll need to do the check in where your documents will be controlled there 's also a security control where the luggage you 'll board with you on the plane will be checked then you will you be free to wait in an area where you can buy presents eat something or you can go to the bathroom then you 'll finally be able to board on your plane and after all that steps your flight will start
but it has a lot of advantages for example students can write long documents or reports faster and in an easy way also they 'll be able to save them all in the same place and in addition they can search for any information they need on the internet and do investigations
in my opinion times are changing and there are a lot of people that have start learning virtually so it has been proved that both methods have their own advantages and it 'll depend on each student which one to choose maybe depending on their likes and preferences
they can get to know how to get organised when they are working with other people for example how to involve each other 's opinions
definitely as i think that teachers can explain any subject in a more interesting and easy way
i think many tourists are coming there
i often enjoy baking sweet for example chiffon cake and i 'm feel happy when my family eat and tells me it is delicious
my little sister enjoy playing catch ball with me because i and she likes baseball very much
i think the advantages of all students getting jobs to pay for their university studies is students can get the working skills in advance i think it will be useful in their future and that the disadvantage of is that students can not concentrate on their study in my opinion the most of important those things for the student is definitely study
i 'll explain what you need to do to travel by airplane firstly you have to go to airport by car or train or something and next you have to pass the document control and security and if you go abroad you need to show a passport and the check is finished you wait
by studying together students can get the communication skills to cooperate with other member i think it will be useful in their future so it is very important things in education
learning facilities very important things because if we gave the good learning facilities students can concentrate on their study more
i am very interesting for the environment because i think nowadays we live in a pandemic with the contamination and it 's necessary to save the planet for this reason i practice a vegan diet rich in plant protein
it 's a difficult question because we go to different places but usually we go to the beach and prepare a little picnic with junk food and we talk about our life
i think i 'm most similar with my little brother because we love the same activities we watch the same movies science fiction in these days
in the future i really like to live in the same place where i live in this moment because i really love my island and i love to wake up in the morning and see the ocean
on the one hand i think it 's a good initiative with the schools because nowadays obesity is a global pandemic in the world usually in kids on the other hand i think it 's not a good idea because i think everybody decide for personal decision practice or not practise this sport in my opinion it 's a difficult question for me because i do n't know i think it 's good but i will disagree for the idea
first bees collected nectar from the different flowers then these bees made honey from nectar in beehives one time later beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put the honey in different bottles
the advantage of study in second language of course if you learning and you practice and practice and practice this idiom when you finish your studies you are an expert in this language
i think the most difficult firstly is the language of course depend the places but i think it 's the language and then i think for example the weather you go to for example poland the weather of gran canaria and poland is complete different
i think a student learn many culture the places typical place for example theatres museums and so on but i think the most important is the food because food is a important culture in every places
i think it 's real because the last year i went to erasmus and when i backed home i am become independent with my family because one year in other country you change absolutely so i agree
my favourite time of year i think is my birthday i 'd really like this day the twenty ninth october because i used to celebrate my birthday with all my family my boyfriend
to me is really important because i really want to be aware of what it 's happening in the world so i used to read the newspaper every day i mean every morning
i used to spend my time with my sister playing games
i hope to be working in a fashion company as human resource because it 's my dream since i was a child and if it 's not possible i would like to work as buyer because i really like the fashion world
i think the the period of practical work experience is the best way to find what do you want to do in the future in my case for example i did n't know if i wanted to to be a lawyer or if i want to be human resource so i start my internship in a company and it was fantastic it was the best experience to me however one of disadvantage was that i need to go to the company to be in practice but i needed to go to the university as well to go class so this is was the worst experience
so as we can see in the graphic tunes net start very bad and now is one of the three most listening online pop music site so it was great for tunes net however songs four you start not too bad but now is less listen site and music now start well start no bad increase a lot but then is decreasing so tunes net is the best one because she starts too bad and now is increasing and increasing a lot
to be a good team leader the person need to be very serious need to be very sensible and need to be good very good under pressure
the problem i think is when you did n't know the person because working with another people is not really easy so the problem i think is that one you need to know about this person
i do n't know about this because in my opinion if you are a good worker you will be good working face to face or work at home so i do n't know
if you have a good team obviously you will have better results that if you are alone however i 'm this kind of person that prefer to work alone
the kabuki performance many times held in there
i usually enjoy watching movies with english subtitles to learn english language and i like action movie for example the avengers and ironman and so on
i have brother i enjoy usually playing game or playing catchball playing music and so on with he
so i want to become pilot in the future
in my opinion all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies is very good things i have two reasons
first travelling airplane we have to go to the airport by your car or bus or train arrival at airport first you need check in at the counter and next document control and security passed and then you can wait to board at front of boarding bridge and next after that all you can board the airplane and go to the other place or other country anywhere in the earth
well they can use many application on the phone for example for english words to learn they do not necessary to carry heavy books
i agree with this opinion because if they have any questions they can ask to the teacher so that is opinion
so i think group project is needed to learn
yes i think so because if the students have any questions they can ask to the teacher as soon as possible
from my point of view learning from another countries should be one of the most important issues in life due to the fact that if you are interesting in learning a new culture or learn a new language it is important to meet another people
what i like the most for enjoying my spare time my free time is to be with friends to be with family
i am try many things to improve my english
if i have the opportunity to learn a new skill i would probably choose to learn to play piano the reason why is because i have always loved music
in my opinion about to get a part job during the time we are in the higher school i mean during the university is that there are few advantages which mean that they can get money and they can be free and they can be independent from their fathers and on the other hand there are few disadvantages as they are for instance that you have less time for studying you have less time for spending with your friend as well and with your girlfriend apart from that i think is nothing wrong with that
factories and vehicles that create some tiny particles into the air which is called pollution these tiny particles become part of the atmosphere and when they get in that and they mix with the clouds they convert in little piece of water that once that is rain this piece of water fall down and comes into the ground which cause a tremendous damage to environment it is called acid rain it is the wind that move the particles from where the factories and vehicles are to this natural environmental
is one of the best thing people can do in order to recharge their batteries
well at the moment i am not having a lot of holidays because i am studying a lot but if i had holidays i would go on the beach and to see the mountains
let me a few seconds to collect my thoughts
i love this question because nowadays i am studying nursing and i love really much this job
well the advantages maybe are if they get money to pay their career they will help their families and get some new skills for their future but as far as i 'm concerned i think that it 's very useful to work while you are studying because this way you can prepare to the real world
if you are thinking going on holiday you may know some tips to get by plane first of all you may choose the way to arrive to the airport then you must do check in showing your passport or identification card to the control place there there will be an agent of security and you must be very patient with it then if you have to wait to your plane leaves you can take a coffee then you are going abroad and then you enjoy your trip thank you
let me a few seconds to collect my thoughts
well to be honest this is not a topic i really talk to
no i am not so sure about that because when you are reading alone you have more concentration and you may get some skills alone
ok i live in a rural area so it is the best
in my holiday i often go to park to play soccer with my friends who are majoring in engineering which is same as me
i often go the park to play soccer with my brother who is in family member and we always enjoy it
oh that 's good question in the future i would like to be airline pilot so there are two reasons to be airline pilot and first one is i like to control something and second one is i like to member in the team
so there are two advantages that students get jobs to pay for their university studies and the first one is students can improve the like communication skill in the job part time job and second one is that they can learn about how to use money to use and the disadvantages is that if they have so much like work it 's gon na be they do n't have much time to study which is the most important for student and in my opinion i recommend that students should get jobs i mean you know like communication skills and experience in the job is very useful and important for society
all right so i am talking about what we need to do to travel by airplane so there are one two three four five six seven eight procedures and first step is that we travel to airport by car by bus or by train and then when you arrived at airport you have to check in to the counter and you have to show the document about yourself and the counter people check the document and then also you have to check the security your security and then you can have time to wait to like take a rest or drink a coffee and then after that you will board to the airplane and then enjoy your flying
okay so i talking about how can use technology more effectively to study and i think the best way to use technology to study is to use like a application in the smartphone
yeah i agree with that i mean you know face to face like studying and learning is that good for like communication with other people
in group project a student can get communication skills for example like if there is someone who does n't know about it and someone can teach to someone that is good
i mean they just going to the class and taking a lecture so it 's easy to take it
i think it is not so important to take modern learning facilities in the school i mean you know if there is it 's better but it does n't matter that we have learn or not
i always have been interesting to learn about other countries actually i have been living in italy and in new zealand as well because i want to learn from other cultures the way that they live the way that they eat and all surrounding about that new place
the most part of my free time i 'm outside we can say that we go to climb mountain biking and hiking
i have too many techniques to improve my english one of that is try to speak in english with every speaker person english person that i find and on the other hand i try to watch every movie and every t v show in english if i can
probably i will choose to learn to drive a motorbike i never been a good driver no even cars so on the last two years i have been seriously thinking about to get a cool motorbike but on the other hand i do n't have the license
like every decision in life when we work when we are studying at the university it have some advantage and disadvantage one good advantage is when you are working and studying at the same time you can use the theory learns and knowledge that you are getting when you are studying and put it in practice when you work at the same time that part time work give you some economy resources that you can use in your daily basis on the other hand it have some disadvantage as well for example you have less time to spend with your friends you has less time to study and you have less time to practice a sport so in my opinion it 's all about to find a good balance between your part time your student time and your work time
the acid rain is one of the main consequence of our activity as a human being on this planet all start with our factories and our vehicles that produce smoke that smoke carry on too many acid particulars that they go up until the sky why i say in our food because that particles go to the water and that water have the fishes that we later will eat so at the end all that pollution get in our own bodies at the same time that rain get into the fruit that we eat as well on the forest and on the farms so
it 's that simple processed food does n't give you enough calories processed food poison you so stop
drinking water is as important as breathe we actually need water for survive we just have to think that most part of our bodies are water so we have to refuel that amount of water with drinking at least one litre per day at least
yes it 's absolutely essential to do exercise every day when we say that we do n't have to think about to do a sport when we say exercise it can be walking around your neighborhood
i 'm agree with that but on the other hand the reality is that there are people who just can sleep for six hours and they work really well is just depends of the person
technology have mainly bad effect on the people because they do n't use it on the right away technology can provide us too many apps which we can learn how to eat how to exercise and how to sleep well
a lot i 've been studying about other countries since i was little kid so i can say it a lot
i like to enjoy it by doing some sports namely playing some football then i enjoy hanging out with my friends
i think it is to interact with the native english speakers so they can advise me how to speak properly their language and studying some grammar and some vocabulary
the power of communication because i think it is very important to communicate with other people in a good way so they can have a good image of us
university students should do part time jobs how they are studying because it helps them how to interact with others and knowing better the worlds of work besides that it helps them how to earn some money the disadvantages they will have less free time to enjoy funny moments in my opinion i think they should do part time jobs because it has more advantages than disadvantages
the pollution begins with vehicles and factories they create pollution that it goes up to the air when it goes up to the air it transports acid particles in the smoke when they reach the air they are carrieds by winds the wind makes them reach the clouds but some of them end up falling as dust the others that reached the clouds they mixed with cloud water
like i said before i think you should drink a lot of water and eat a lot of vegetables and besides this you should eat as well meat it keeps you fit strong and healthy i think
once again like i said before it is important to do exercise during the day it keeps you active and it is good for your mental health as well as your physical health
it depends on the person some of them need to sleep eight hours some of them need to sleep less some more it depends on the person basically everyone is different
it had a huge positive effect because it gives you a lot of information about your body and what you should eat or drink and maintains you aware of dangers
i live in a big house with four floors and it 's a massive house i live with my family and i share the room with my daughter which is sometimes very difficult but she is very demanding so that 's what it is
when i 'm on holidays i love surfing and when i am in the beach i feel very relax and i think going to the beach is the best way to forget about all the problems that you have in your daily basis
i love spending time with my sister because she is very similar to me and we spend time talking about magazines clothes businesses
i am training myself to be a teacher so i 'm aim to have that goal in the future i want to become a teacher teach economics and probably teach spanish to foreign people so yeah that 's what it this
the advantages to have a job while you are studying at the university are the free time that you are going to have to spend with your colleagues
when you have to take a flight the first thing that you have to do is obviously to travel to the airport you can take your car you can go by bus and you can take a train when you are already in the airport you can have some coffee or have some meals in the duty free to prepare yourself to do in the last stage the check in why do you need to do the check in you need to do the check in to show your passport and to give the ticket to the woman or man who are in the front of the window to take the plane
students can use youtube videos for example to have more information about a topic they can for example use podcasts listen to podcasts while they are running while they are doing sport and that could be a very good option
i think it 's true learn face to face with a teacher is better but it 's true that nowadays there are lot of tools online where you can speak with a computer like i 'm doing now and it 's completely useful
they can learn how to work in a team they can learn how to be a good leader leadership is very important to work in a multinational company for example
i think reading alone is actually very effective you can prepare yourself be in a relaxed environment in your room in your living room and for me it 's more effective than attending lectures
i think at the moment it 's very important for universities to do that because we are in very difficult times
i 'm so interest because i think it 's important things in our diary lifes
we love playing football playing basketball watching films walking our dog in nature
the most similar person in my family is my mum
i would like to live in spain maybe in the north of spain
in my opinion it is a very interesting topic i agree with it it has both advantage and disadvantage the main advantage is that it can make you feel better but you should not obsess about it
first the best collect nectar from flowers after then bees make honey from the nectar in beehives then beekeepers collect the honey from beehives
i think it does have importance but not as much as we think
i think the most difficult is to be far from your house from your parents from your friends from your girlfriend it 's the most difficult thing
the students can learn about his food its culture its language its philosophy its weather
i agree with this i believe it can improve your life as it has improved the lives of others
i 'm interested a lot in that actually my first degree is in world economics so i am really interested in communicating with people from other cultures this is partially why i came to one of the most multicultural cities in the world toronto
basically my hobby is the same as my primary occupation i enjoy learning languages english is not the only foreign language that i can speak i can also speak french quite fluently and bit of german however my german got a bit rusty over time just because of the lack of time for maintenance
i strongly believe that the most natural and the most efficient way to improve any language is to speak to their native speakers so whenever i have the chance and the opportunity i try to communicate with as many native speakers i can encounter as possible
well it would definitely be coding because i think this is an essential skill not necessarily in software engineering but in so many other fields from linguistics to accounting to financial analysis
well i know that many people have different approaches towards the idea of students doing part time jobs while they are studying on the one hand there are some advantages to this like learning proper time management developing interpersonal skills being able to communicate with people from different backgrounds however there are some disadvantages associated with it as well for example some students may find it hard to prioritise their studies over their part time job and they can get carried away with what they do in their part time job easily so i do n't think it is always an advantageous situation for the student to do both
so this picture represents the cycle of the acid rain in nature i wish it was a nice healthy rain but unfortunately this is not the case so essentially the way acid train originates is that pollution is evaporated from factory chimneys and vehicles into the atmosphere and acid particles in the form of smoke are carried by the wind towards the upper layers of the atmosphere and then they are carried further in different directions after which some acid particles fall out as dust and some other acid particles mix with cloud water
well i would definitely advise that they eat as much vegetables and fruits as possible and that they eat regularly and avoid eating just before bed or eating too much during their lunchtime
i think it 's definitely very important to drink lots of water although i know some scientists start to contest this premise so essentially drinking anywhere between five to eight glasses of water per day is considered healthy
well i would say it is essential to do exercise at least every second day every day would be ideal but unfortunately i know it may not necessarily be feasible for everyone
well it depends on the person i know some friends of mine can easily cope with six hours of sleep whereas i am not this kind of person i need more hours of sleep eight hours is an ideal number but sometimes i sleep more
well it depends on how you look at it of course there were lot of negative effects like we 're becoming more and more sedentary just because of the technology use we 're not confined to our screen at work only
so we have to take care of it
we enjoy playing golf but if weather condition is not good we will go shopping or watching movies to enjoy ourselves
my son is most similar to me although i 'm not sure if he is so happy that he is similar to me but everybody pointed out that his attitude is quite similar to me that 's very fine
if i can select wherever i want i want to live nearby the sea because my hobby is fishing so i can enjoy fishing every day after retirement
it 's no doubt that fitness is very essential to keep healthy for students so the biggest advantage is keeping students healthy and they can concentrate on studying very much but disadvantages is students will lose the time to study but as a result my opinion is that i agree to make time for fitness class
so from the beginning at the beginning of course bees collect nectar from flowers and farmers collect honey from beehives and they will pack the honey into small bottles and deliver to supermarket where we can buy the honey so
of course language in the country is well key however the other and very essential factors is the safety safety is required for study
because it is a second language the speaker also very take care of their body language it 's easy for us to understand second language
in addition to the language the lifestyle and culture is also very big handicap for students especially at the beginning of entering the country
i fully agree with that students should live alone and independently in abroad because they are away from their parents
my favourite time of year in italy is the summer because the weather is very good and you have time to spend with friends your family i especially like to play soccer and other sports
listen and read the news is very important because you have to know what is the situation in your locality in your city in your town in your country you have to be informed
when i was a child i really spent my free time playing whatever video game like fifa or playing soccer with my brother or spending time with my mom
actually i do n't really know but i think it could be continue with the family company because i know that i can help to improve some process like sales or something
as you know nowadays all university courses should include a period of practical work experience and it is very good but do you know what are the advantages of that it 's easy the highest advantage of that is that it could help you to get a lot of new knowledge or new experience or something that you would be using in the future in your area of your work but there are lot of disadvantages for example you wo n't be able to spend time that you would like to or with your friends or you would be stressed in the future so in my opinion i think it is important to all students to include a period of practical work experience because it will help them in the future
as you know nowadays there is a lot of apps or websites that you can use to listen music online but we will be focus on three tunes net that are the red one music now that are the blue one and usongs for you that are the yellow one and as you can see on average the blue one that are music now has the highest number of people listening their music per day but you can see too that the tunes net has a considerable increasing until fifth day
a good team leader have to have some aptitude to improve and develop the performance of the team for example leadership honestly a good communication things like that
i do n't think there is a lot of problems if you are working in small teams but one could be that the work wo n't be divided equitably so you can have a lot of work
i do n't think that the teamwork have to be always face to face between the team members but most of the times it could be helpful because in this way you have more opportunity to speak with your members and have a good communication
yes i am completely agree with that you will achieve better results if you are in a team than if you are alone
it is large city it has got a river it has got one circus lots of theatres there are lots of parks in our city and very very many shopping centres
when i am on holiday i enjoy travelling to other places meet new people and see new places and take a lots of photo of these places
he is twelve and he 's very interesting boy it is interesting to speak with him and take him some games
i think i will not have any new job in the future because i 'm old enough to start new job but if i would have new job i think it could be an instructor or teacher
i think there are no advantages at all for students to get jobs to pay for their university studies because they will spend time working not studying as for me part time jobs for students is good just in a case when student works for his future speciality so he can be more experienced and confident in his part of speciality
to travel by airplane first you need to travel to airport then you should check in and pass document control when you show your passport and security control where you show your things and goods after this you wait for your plane you can wait for some hours it depends on how early or late you arrived to the airport then you come on board and after this when you take your place you can fly so your plane is taking off
students can use internet to find out information they need
i think it is really best when you have got a proper teacher so when you are lucky enough to have the teacher of your dream the teacher of your life it is better to study face to face with him
working as a group students can develop communication skills of course and to work as a team is a good skill for the future work too
different students have different types of learning for some students attending lectures is better but for other students attending lectures is not good they prefer read books and it is better for them than attending lectures
modern facilities can make lectures more interesting for students
i really enjoy visiting monuments and in general differents points of interest of the city and i really like to relax with my husband at the beach
i like spending time with my mum because we really like to go shopping together and do exercise when at the weekends we can do it and we spend a lot of time together
i think that students should get jobs for pay their university studies in the case they do n't have parents ' support but i think that it will be better that the students only be focus on their studies because due to their job they could n't have enough time to study because the timetables or the job in general no fits very well with their studies and i think that it will be better only they are focus in their education
first of all this journey begins with the taking a mean of transport a bus or a car for instance or maybe a train then you will arrive at the airport and you have to do a check in check your boarding pass on the desk with your passport then you can find the police on the staff security and you pass several controls then you have to wait a few hours while the flight arrives and then you go on board and take off
for instance the technology 's a good way to learn languages because the students can practise more about the languages watching videos for instance and listening to music and i think this are good
i really think that the learning face to face with the teacher is the best option because you are more confidence with your teacher
and this way helps for working in groups and sharing a lot
not necessary i think that attending lectures is a good option to listen the opinions or other people
i think that 's really important because learning facilities help us to study more and better and i think that they should provide more facilities like computers or tablets something like that
i enjoy playing tennis with my colleague and i can reduce my stress for playing tennis and moving body is good at be health
i always with my sister and we are watching netflix together and sometimes we are going for a trip to enjoy my vacation
i would like to working as a pilot to save many people 's life because now we are suffering from covid nineteen and there is a lot of vaccine i would like to send it all of the world
first of all the advantages is students can know about how university will cost that makes students more concentrate to learn in the university that is the bad thing and but in my opinion that is good to get a job for the university because it will more concentrate to learn in the university
today i 'm going to talk about what people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all use the public transportation to travel to the airport after arriving at airport you may go to check in counter and finish check in after that you should pass the document control and show to the security all your baggage and after that you will wait at the gate at that time you should go to the toilet or caff or drinking coffee or shopping then board to the airplane and take off
well the student can use a tablet for studying and that makes students studying everywhere anytime
i think it is very good things because if you have a question you can ask to the teacher or friends as soon as possible
on the group project students can improve communication skills at the time
yes it is true attending lectures if you have a question you can ask to teachers or friends at the time
i think that is not so important to university to introduce learning facility modern learning facility because we have a lot of books and that makes people more studying
oh sure i live in an apartment with three bedrooms a bathroom a living room a large table and i also live with two cats the cats belong to my sister we also have a light kitchen and a washing room
we most of the time make a picnic together we eat we cook together too sometimes we go to the movie together and i also like to visit of some friends of mine
well i love to spend time with my sister we are very alike we enjoy doing the same things the same movies and we also have very similar world views about some topics like politics environment and also about art it is very funny to be with her
i would like to have two types of job i 'd like to be a professor at university and but also a curator at a musuem at the university i 'd like to teach history of art specially contemporary art and african art
they can also build their networks and it can also influence their future well there are also disadvantages they have probably less time to study and to prepare themselves for exams and the worst thing is that they can engage less on the university activities and it can truly damage their academical prospect well in my point of view it is better for students not to work during their courses because they have to dedicate themselves full time for their university and not with a job that will probably not have any relationship with their future profession then i guess they should take a student loan or ask money for their parents this is what i think about
first of all you have to get to the airport by bus by train or with a personal car also with a taxi when you arrive at the airport you have to look for the airline company and to maybe leave your luggage there after that you got ta look for the officers to show your document then you have to wait until your flight 's being called you can have a coffee go to the restroom and when your flight is being called you have to go to the gates and then enter in the airplane and finally you begin to fly
they can access youtube channels they can have online books they can also download plenty of p d fs of books and there are also applications
it may be better to learn directly with a teacher but it 's not the only way of learning people can learn from the internet via skype people can also learn alone at home with books well i guess that the internet is the biggest teacher nowadays
the most important thing on working together in groups and so on is to exchange ideas and to receive feedbacks about your own ideas and also to give feedback about the idea of a colleague
i think it depends on each student we ca n't generalize such a thing some of them they like to go to attend a lecture and to get to know the teacher and to deep their relationship some other like just to stay at home and reading and this is more effective
well in my point of view modern learning facilities they play a very important role on the development of each student it is also take a very important influence on the future of the students because they can learn more effectively
i 'm very interested in environment because we are devastating this world
well we like to play football we like to read books
maybe one of my brothers and maybe my son as well we are very similars
in this world
well i agree on the other hand as a disadvantage i think it would be caused some injuries and some pupils could be exhausted after fitness class but in general i agree i think that a healthy mind in a healthy body is a good thing yes so i agree and i think it 's necessary also
the first step is the bees collect nectar from flowers the second step is that bees make honey from nectar in beehives the third step is the beekeepers collect honey from beehives the four step is when the honey is putted on crystal cans and then the fifth step is the honey is delivered the shops and the last step is when the honey is in the supermarkets
well i would like they provide me a job to earn some money for my living and a teacher i would like to dispose a teacher for me
it would open my options to find out a work abroad in other countries and my own culture level i think it good for me
the local music the folk music and the local rest days
i totally agree ok they go out to other country they are separate from his mother 's nest and have to make the things by themself i 'm totally agree
i love learning about foreign countries and about their culture about their history about their politics because this is what it fills my soul actually
i do n't have that much free time but when it came i love travelling and i love to go to the museum just to cultivate myself about different things and also read on political history
the best way for me to improve my english it 's to watch english or american channel and also to watch some t v show in english
if it was possible i think i would like to learn how to fly but it 's not possible actually so i would like to just speak another language like chinese
one of the advantage of working as a student it 's to be financially independent and also to know how professional environment works and how to manage different environment but there is also backfires to this for example one of the most inconvenient thing is we can be tired i mean students could be tired from their part time jobs depends on the job that they do delivery or shopper or whatever but it has to be short
acid rain is one of the most damage phenomenon to the environment today but how this forms in the environment this particles in smoke forms smog that are spread in the air some of them continues their journey to mix with clouds just a reminder that clouds are made up with water and acid particles become a part of the cloud in consequence depends on the temperature rain or snow may contain a large part of particles and acid particles which is lead to acid rain or acid snow which can be really damage to the environment
healthier lifestyle start with nutrition and as far as i 'm concerned we must forbidden eating between meals and drink a lot of water like about one point five litre day or two litres per day whatever
our bodies are made with ninety percent of water so we should keep that level all the day because this is where our bodies take all the energy so we should drink a lot of water about two litres per day
more we sleep more our life duration is so in my opinion we should keep constant the eight hours of sleeping each night and even ten hours would be perfect for an adult for example
the advantage of technology is that now we can track every aspect of our bodies and our health and we do n't have to go to the doctor all the time but the other part is we such dependent of that
i usually enjoy spending my free time by dancing i tend to watch choreographies and learn them by watching videos and slowing them down that way i can really learn the details and dance with them with my partner
in the first place i will talk about the disadvantages and then i will talk about the disadvantages firstly the advantages i see while studying and doing part time jobs would be that they will have way more money to do things in their free time and to pay for their studying fees in the other hand we have the disadvantages one big important disadvantages would be having less time to study which could lead to having lower grades so it will be a bit more difficult
first the vehicles and factories make smoke which makes pollution then the acid particles that are in that smoke cause the acid particles carried by the wind the wind makes some acid particles fall as dust which could lead to the river and some lakes to be less clean
i would recommend to go to a nutritionist so they can tell them exactly what they need and what their body needs to have the full energy throughout the day
i do n't think we need to do exercise every day but i think it 's very important to do exercise at least two or three times a week so our body can keep up its shape and be in a healthy weight
generally technology has really improved our health because we do n't have to waste as much energy as we used to with our new technology so i think it was a better improvement
i 'm so interested because you can learn about other cultures so i think is positive in all her sides
maybe the best way is talking with other people of england or united state and you can learn too much about english
maybe the italian language
some advantages that jobs while student are studying are that you maybe knows the real life and you can afford and pay some things that maybe help your parents in the university in the other hand some disadvantages are that you do n't have too much time for study and you will sleep less but in my opinion i think that you are going to learn more about responsibilities and meet other people other work people so definitely it 's a good form to spend your time
that picture show us how acid rain is a product of pollution in our planet first of all factories and vehicles make acid particles that are in smoke and finally we find that particles in the clouds of the planet because are carried by the wind after so yeah is a important damage to environment of our planet and we have to change that to have a better planet
maybe i think that good habit for eating is eats a lot of fruit five times for a day and eat some salad food two times at week
it 's too important to drinking water because sometimes we confuse about drinking water or be hungry
for a person to have a healthy lifestyle i think in my opinion that is too important and essential doing exercise each week because is elemental part of a healthy life
i think that it 's depends of the use of the technology that people make because you can use technology for doing better exercise but maybe you can use technology to watch netflix so it depends
it 's very important for me because if i do n't listen and read to the news i do n't know information about in my country
i want to be a pilot in the future so i am studying about the pilot
so i think i have no idea there are disadvantages and then student can get more experience so that that is absolutely can very good direction to go
first of all do you see the colour clearly red is tune net blue is music now and yellow is songs for you on the first day red will start in third place and blue will start in first place this relationship does not change until the fifth day and on the seventh day of final day rocky is red was first blue overtaken by red was second and yellow was third
i think good team leaders can talk any people so good team leaders can get all peoples ideas
that is very good
i do n't think so recently covid nineteen affect the our lifestyle so we can talk to online like a zoom so i do n't think so need
i am really interested about learning about the other countries because in my opinion the world 's beauty is its diversity so discovering other cultures is the best way to open your mind about other people
i enjoy spending my free time by passing time with my family and my friends doing a lot of shopping working on myself working out and that 's it
the best way for me to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people
if i could learn a new skill it would be boxing or acting or maybe modelling and improving my skills at school
the advantages of it are that first of all students can earn some money and feel responsible but the disadvantages are that it deprives students from a lot of time they can do their homeworks because part time jobs take a lot of time in addition to many hours of school so that 's it
acid rain has a lot of bad effects on environment so first of all it starts from factories and vehicles because they create a lot of pollution then this pollution transforms into acid particles which are in smoke then these acid particles are carried by wide and some of them fall as dust on the floor which damages the environment but other acid particles mix with cloud water and this acid particles transform into rain or snow so we call it acid rain and this acid rain is very negative for the environment
having eating habits is one of the most important thing to having a healthy lifestyle first of all having eating habits permit to feel more comfortable into our body and to feel more healthy every single day and more powerful
drinking water is very necessary if you want to stay energetic all day if you want to feel hydratated and healthy you have to drink water the most that you can many times in a day
doing exercise is a way to be confident in your skin you feel powerful you feel healthy and you feel like you achieve something every time you do exercise you feel powerful
i 'm not the best to talk about sleeping because i do n't sleep a lot which is really bad you have to sleep a lot minimum eight hours in a night because you have to feel energetic for the day without it you ca n't
so having eating habits drinking water doing exercise and sleeping are the main things to keep a healthy lifestyle because without them you can be good in your skin
i 'm very interesting in the environment because we have the obligation to save the environment for our health and for the health of our children
my friends and me enjoy together for example go out for the countryside to hike
yes and my familiar and me we are very similar for example my children the older has very similar to me and she look like to me a lot of and the youngest is very similar to me because he 's blond as me
in the futures i think i like to live on the beach because i love the sea i love to walk on the beach and i prefer to stay there when i am retired
and between the disadvantages we can find that the people lose a lot of time to doing sportive and they do n't dedicate this time to their studies in my opinion maybe the school day do fitness classes must be better on the weekend or one day per week at most but not for all every day is a bad idea for dedicate to a school day to practise sports
i will speak about the honey the moment that the honey is produced by the bees until the moment that you can find this honey in your shop the bees collect nectar from flowers and they go to the panel for make honey from nectar in beehives so after that the beekeepers collect honey from beehives
and so i think is very important for the people can other second language because they improve their language
and also have a very difficult to know to meet other people in a new country that you do n't know person or have friends
question is interesting because they improve their knowledge about a new country and also they know what is the culture in this country and how the people are live there
well definitely i 'm quite interested in to learn about countries that 's something that i appreciate a lot
i do enjoy spending my free time in many different ways but certainly the way i enjoy to spending my time is watching movies because i 'm addict to the films specially those created in the sixties and seventies
throughout all those years i can say that the best way to improve my english is to listening and speaking being surrounded for those kind of activities every single day surely is improving my language level
i am not going to hesitate answering this question definitely that skill will be to play the piano to play the piano would be a dream life for me
oh okay great i will enjoy to talk about this topic the part time jobs while you are studying advantages the clear advantages is despite of the money you will earn one great advantages is you will have some independence in your life and you will not depend on your parents so that is extremely important for me and a clear disadvantages that is part time jobs are not created for everyone because everyone has not the commitment to fulfil all their responsibilities between their studies between her tutions and between her part time jobs so those students are not going to fulfill all the requirements what is my opinion everyone must be aware whether it 's in the group one or two
the acid rain it 's something that involves everyone in society you know the acid rain it 's represented in every single season of the year it does n't matter if you are in summer winter fall autumn you will see the risks of the acid rain every day in your single life it is a cycle that involves many factors vehicles trees some plants and at the end the damage to the environment it 's quite important and significantive so at the end it destroys our nature and our lives
my most significant advice definitely would be if you mind about your health about your physical appearance and about your good looking and even more about your sexuality you should concern about your eating habits do n't eat hamburgers
to drink lots of water it 's extremely important for our healthy because you know we are seventy percent composed by water so if an organism like our organism is composed by water and if you do n't drink water so come on is something wrong
people said that just because science has proved that eight hours is a cool average for our health by the way you should try ten twelve hours and will be fine
technology has had a negative effect on people 's health
i live in a small town with my wife in a small flat but we are moving to new flat bigger than this
when i am with holiday i enjoy it to travel i like to travel around the world i already visit more than thirty countries between european countries and countries all over the world
i like to spend my free time with my wife and with my parents and also with my nephews i have nine nephews and i enjoy so much the time i can spend with them
in the future and more or less in a few years no more than three years i would like to get a job as a civil servant
so the advantage of the students get jobs to pay their university students the main advantage in my opinion is that the students can appreciate their parents ' effort to pay their studies and in the other hand the main disadvantage is that they ca n't focus on their studies because they have to work
so if you want to travel by airplane first you should go to the airport i prefer to go by public transport and then you have to do the check in to get your boarding pass after that you have to show your document control at the security control and after that you have to wait your flight maybe you spend one or two hours while your flight take off
i think that nowadays through technologies you can learn face to face with teachers
it depends and that 's no only one way to learn for a group of people could be more interesting to read alone
to provide learning facilities is very important for student but not all teachers can use properly the i c ts
it depends on the country but i really like to learn new things so i think i 'm really interested
i do quite a lot of things but i 'm daydreaming all the time i am always daydreaming when i 'm walking i also really like reading listening music and watching movies
i think my english is quite good except the talking part so speaking with someone native would be helpful i think
i really would love to play a piano also i really want to be good at cooking it would be helpful
besides that getting your money while studying is almost everyone 's dream being separated from their family it 's not always easy to ask money from parents so earning their money would be so helpful really boost the confidence i think those are the advantages and my final opinion is some university students should do that
okay main cause of acid rains is pollution waste product from the vehicles and some factories in gas form and some acid particles from their smoke join air then are carried by the wind after that some part of this particles fall from sky as dust while the other part is mixing with water in clouds this is what we called acid rain
first thing they should do is cut off junk food if they are really addicted to it they start small and aim higher then and i also think gluten free lifestyle is better i do that
it 's quite important we need to drink water at least three liter per day and it 's really help homeostasis it is great
not every day but we should do exercise regularly the days that we do n't do exercise we should walk instead we keep ourselfs active
depends the on people like i need more than eight hours sleeping is really good way to reduce toxic in our brain
it has generally a good effect it is really positive we can do surveys we keep track on our patients
yeah i live in a very quiet city is located in the centre of my country in this case mexico
usually i enjoy in my holidays to do or make some travels and spend time with my family with my friends that they live in another countries and yeah
i think that could be my mom i have a good or a great relationship with her and also i really love spend my time with my dog and her name is freda
the advantage that all students should get job to pay for university students i think that are about you increase your experience at the industrial or commercial field and helps so much in your development but disadvantage that normally does n't have time to do all activities or assignments that you must do it and my opinion i think that is good to look at a balance with those
if you travelling by airplane first of all you make to travel to airport and then to do a check in with a receptionist and also you must to provide your documents to a security personnel and then you board and yeah finally you board your flight
and it 's important to understand the project
i think that dependent on the kind of each person for me is better to learn alone because i think that i concentrate more but attending lectures that helps so much other people
it 's very important because you stay in a place where you feel very comfortable is very easy to learn and improve every day in the field that you want improve
i have actually a deep interest in learn about other countries because i believe it 's a good way to improve and develop our knowledge
i do n't have so much spare time but from time to time i like to go running on the street and also at the woods
i would love to know how to play an instrument for example piano or violin i think it 's so difficult but no pain no gain so i probably start learning about music and about the basics
going to university it 's for itself a complicated decision so having a part time job could bring the same benefit and the same disdvantage at the same time first of all we are going compare the advantage and the disadvantage of having this kind of job firstly we have to know that university is complicated so we have to have the enough time to do our homework hang with friends and have the freedom of going out and spending some time with your classmates and of course you have to study for your exams so having a part time job could waste your time and maybe you are n't able study enough on the other side having this kind of job could make you earn some money
welcome ladies and gentlemans to my presentation today we are going to talk about acid rain acid rain is a common problem nowadays and we have to find a way of eliminate it the vehicles and the factories as we all know cause pollution and this pollution usually create acid particles that go into the smoke of these factories these acid particles could be carried by wind and could also mix in the clouds with water if this happen then acid rain is going to fall onto the ground and damage the environment as well as humans animals and the fields of the farmers for example
for all those people that want to develop eating healthy habits i would say them that they have to have a strong willpower for achieve they objective but if they have a never say die attitude i 'm sure they going to have a healthy life
drinking water extremely important for the human being because we are created and we are made of a highly percentage of water
from my point of view doing exercise is so important in our daily life of course if we are so busy we can just sleep the exercise and do the next day
the study shows that human has to sleep at least eight hours a day so i 'm completely agree with this affirmation because we have to be healthy also in our sleep
it depends technology could have a bad or a good effect or an advantage a disadvantage it all depends on the way we use this technology if we are so atached to this technology we can develop an addiction and this is a really bad problem
i live in a small town that they have a lot of mountain in the near and it 's localizated in basque country near the sea if north of spain
when i 'm holiday i like enjoy visiting different place so i like know different place because i think it 's very interesting meeting different place
is true that is very important that the student should get job to pay for their university studies because they have a possibly to independence and no depend of the parents ' economic and if they need money to pay their university it 's important that they parents help their in my opinion it 's a good idea that the different students working and they won a lot of money to pay their studies
now i explain about what you need to do to travel by airplane then when you go to airport you need check in your suitcase then you need pass to document control and you need pass to security control then if you have more time you wait in the bar or in the cafe then you go to the airport
i think that if you read alone you will more concentrated in this lectures
i am not an environmentalist but i do wanna devote more time for myself to learn more about our planet and the environment around us because i do think for human sustainability we do need to be careful
and we love the ones that are not thrilling or are not very hectic to go and we love to have fun together
i am most similar to my mom because she is very outgoing and friendly to everyone and to me i think this is very important because treating everyone else very friendly they are going to giving back to you the same thing and family to me is very important
i do n't have a city in my mind yet but i would love to travel as much as i can and right now i have n't been to europe for a while and i want to go to england and greece and try a lot of places and i want to experience a lot of places before i decide it
the advantages of students who do the fitness class during the school day is they can have free time to practise their fitness and help them to build a healthy body and the disadvantages for them is that they may delay the time for them to study and they also may distribute their attention to the fitness classes so that they might not interesting in their academic courses anymore
the graph is about the honey from flower to shop the first step of honey is being collect by the bees nectar from flowers the bees make honey from nectar in beehives then the beekeepers collect honey from beehives and add them to the bottle after collecting honey in a bottle there will be the truck deliver to deliver the honey to the shop the final step of honey is that they will be sell on the shelf
well i think that first of all the most important thing is the safety of that country after that it should be the climate of the country whether the student are suitable for it
well the benefit of that is that first of all you can really know how to speak a second language and after that in lots of second language country the culture is so different and it 's a joy to learn in other language to know their culture by that
well first of all the difficult must come from the influence by the culture because they were so many different habit of other countries ' people and also the difficult may be because of the language course
well the fast way for a student to learn about the local culture is to become friends with some local people and in that case they can take you to maybe their festivals and in that case they can learn about the culture
i agree with that kind of idea because when you study at the other country is mostly likely that you are on your own and you have to do everything by yourself because there are no parents long with you and so in that case you can become more independent
it 's quite good i like it
well there are a number of things that i like i think that the most thing that i enjoy may be football
well that 's a tricky question it 's difficult to answer because we are a wide family but i would say that maybe my grandmother we used to watch television at night and this is a good moment for both of us because we catch up between us
i have done psychology and ontology
i think that the main advantages is that they are going to be able to pay their students loans and this is going to give them a sense of responsibility but i also think that there are some disadvantages added to it that is that the time that they are going to spend on those jobs they are n't going to be able to use for studying and well studying is very important for having a better job in the future so it could be a downbreak in my opinion it 's a good thing having a job and not just because of the money but also because of the future prospect that the students will have about their future jobs they will have a first experience to know how it going to be
while it is important to arrive to the airport two hours previous to the take off it is also necessary to be well aware of the things that are allowed to pass through the control for example we are not able to go with metallic gadgets or any kind of white arms a knife it 's impossible to pass through the security control as we have been two hours previous to the take off we are going to have a quiet time a lot of time to wait so we can spend in the cafeteria restaurants or any kind of gift shop that there are in the airport and then it 's just waiting to the hostess to ask for us
i have experiences the both sides of the both and i would say that maybe the face to face learning or school is better than the one online so it 's more comfortable
there are many things
well it depends on the persons but many people just by reading something can catch everything so it really depends on the personal preference and their abilities
i 'm very interested because it 's very important for everyone
i like to go swimming or ride a bike or sometimes go to walk and spending time with my family
i think that is my father
i think that is very important students do fit class because it is healthy for students i think that it have to continue
well the tips for do honey is first bees collect nectar from the flowers then the bees fly to the beehives and they make honey from the nectar then it is put into glasses and then some people carry it to the different places to sell it
i think that the principal thing that they have to consider it is the prices or the coins that is going to use and where they are going to live is very important
i think that it is very important because it can open some doors and opportunities for the students if the students can speak two or maybe three language for their professions
it is difficult really difficult because they have to go away of their family or their houses they have to live a new kind of life and it 's very difficult
now i 'm living in a apartment with two bedroom and with one of my colleagues it 's very convenient and you know the sight is very good at there because it 's fifteen floor
well in holiday i like to stay with my colleagues going outside together visiting some museum or you know heritage sites as well
currently i do n't have a clear view about my future i hope i can take a job that is not requires lots of time but can have a very high salary yeah
well the advantages of university students taking a job to offer their payment of university fees first of all they can get more familiar with the working environment after the graduation which will benefit for the job seeking or even the career development so for my opinion the university students should take part time jobs under the regulation of the university to guarantee the study time and yeah
the diagram shows the procedure of travelling by airplane first of all you need to travel to the airport you can choose any kind of transportation likes your private car or train or bus to arrive the airport and then you have to hand out the document to the security to pass the security check and wait until the boarding time to you know get on the plane
there are several ways for students to use technologies in their study the most important one is the search engine likes google they can search the materials that they wants of any kind from the internet and use them
well i agree with this idea
well in the group project the most important thing they can obtain is the group cooperation with other people which will be very important in the working environment because most of us will work in a company
well yes i think attending a lecture is very important because if you study alone it 's a big challenge to your self discipline but if you attend a lecture the teacher will control your study
well i think the learning facilities is very important in the university
i think that the environment is very important for our lives because without environment there is n't life
i love my family
i am happy to talk about this topic because for me is very important the the fitness classes because are very important for a healthy life schools and college should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes in my opinion is a very important to do fitness classes because you will be strong and more intelligent
i go to speak about honey from flower to shop the bees collect nectar from flowers next bees make honey from nectar in beehives later beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put the honey in bottles next the beekeepers put the bottles in the vehicle
i think that is very important studying in another country because you will learn their language and other culture
i think that the more difficulty of studying in another country is learn other language
when you study in a other country you learn a local culture
living in another country it will the person be more independent
i 'm deeply interested in learning about other countries and my two favorite things to learn about them it 's try its food and also learn something words from your language
i really enjoyed relaxing in my house so i spend my free time here in my house watching movies or some t v shows and eating popcorns or drinking coffee or something like that
i think that the best way to improve my english is through immersion i mean going to a country where english is spoken but the second best way to learn about english is watching t v shows in english and listening to music in english
i think that it will be cooking i mean right now i do n't enjoy it because i think that i do n't know how to do it correctly
okay i find some advantages in working and a student at the same time some of them are that you can practice what you learn in the schools when you are working so you gain experience in the area and you also start to know people who 's working in this area and you can build some networking in the field well i also think that it has disadvantages coz working and studying requires time and is a huge responsibility which could be so stressful at the end i think that it is very useful and students should do part time jobs while they are studying because at the end it has a positive impact in your experience and it could help you to find a job
today we 're gon na talk about acid rain acid rain is caused by pollution this pollution is principally emitted by factories and vehicles and we 're talking about smoke this smoke has some acid particles and these acid particles are carried by wind this acid rain is toxic so it has severe damages to our environment because not only damage our plants but also microorganisms in our soil
my advice to this people is that they plan their meals it could help you to be prepare when you have hungry and not full in this junk food that you can find in the streets
it 's difficult to determine how much is a lot but the recommendation is that you should drink at least two liters of water every day that 's what our body needs to maintain hydratation
absolutely in my opinion is vital to do exercise every day the recommendation is to do at least thirty minutes of exercise this can improve our health in a good way
i think that each body is different someone can just need six hours of the sleeping and another bodies can need nine hours of sleeping
i think that it can have both for one side we can have all these apps and programs that are useful to track our habits of exercise or eating
i am interested in learning about other countries so much because i think learning more about others countries can have a deeper insight into other cultures and broaden my horizons
i enjoy spending my free time by reading books watching movies watching drama series and have an out with my friends
as for improving my oral english i think it is better to speak as much as possible with your foreign friends and read as much as possible too
i think it could be cooking because cooking is a important skill for independent life and through cooking i can make delicious meals for my families to spread happiness and well being
i think the advantages are students can get more practical skills and combine what they have learned in their textbooks with their experiences through doing part time jobs but the disadvantages are that they may be easily distracted from class and leading to their poor grades so i think it is better to strike a balance between doing part time jobs and study and students should make the most appropriate part time jobs for themselves so because part time jobs vary from person to person and they should choose their individual jobs
pollution given off from factories and the vehicles contains smoke which acid particles are in and they are carried by the wind some of them fall as dust and others mix with cloud water to form rain or snow which is also called acid rain and acid rain can do harm to the environment which has raised people 's awareness of it
i think it is persistence and self discipline
i 'm in favour of it enough sleep can refresh your mind after a busy day and get you well prepared for the next day but sleeping deprivation can make you stressed next day
i very interesting in other countries because i really like other cultures and i like visit them also i think that this is very important for you
in my free time i really like go to the nature sometimes i go to the park and see the birds of the sky i really like relax
this is a controversial question because i think that exist a lot of methods for learn english
maybe if i can learn one skill this should be learnt a lot of language because i really like other language
i think that this is a controversial topic because it have a lot of advantage and also it has disadvantage for example you can make money if you work while you are studying but you spend a lot of time and this time you should spend study if you want passed the exam of the university for the reason i think that it 's better if you do n't work while you are studying but if you need the money you should work
i 'm going to talk about acid rains in this picture we can see the water cycle first of all we can see like factories and vehicles made pollution and this pollution is in the air next we can see the acid particles are smoke and acid particles are carried by wind
if you want eating good habits i think that you need cook your food
i think that it 's very important that you drink a lot of water because your body it 's formed for eighty percent of water and you need this for live well
i think that it 's not necessary doing exercise every day of the week but if you want stay good with your body i recommend you that you do two times a week exercise
i think that it 's very important that you sleep very well and eight hours for day but if you ca n't one day it 's not important
it 's a controversial topic because in general i think that the technology it 's a good invention but it 's true that the technology produce a lot of stress in a lot of people
it 's well know that the environment need to be healthy for our future and keep the nature in a healthy way and try to stop the pollution and contamination of the environment
my friends and me would like to spend the time going to the cinema going to restaurants or sometime when i hosted a dinner for them and we start to talk about our families our goals and catch up with them
in my point of view the most similar at me is my mother because she has the same love for music classic music and orchestral music so we sometime spend time to listen that kind of music and we enjoy too much
in the future i see myself living in dubai because is a lovely city with an amazing structures and amazing people amazing music it has always been my dream to live there
in nowaday it 's very important to know the advantages and disadvantages about the exercises for example in one hand i can mention one advantages of the fitness classes would be that the system of a school and college teach of the students how to start a healthy life and include in their routines in other hand one of disadvantages will be that time they spending on fitness classes it will be used for feeding they brain
hello good morning today i 'm going to explain you how honey is produced first of all every start with bees bees collect the nectar from flowers and secondly the bees make honey from nectar in beehives third the beekeepers collect that honey from beehives and keep that honey into the good designed honey bottles that honey bottles are organized and then distribuate for the company the company provide this honey to supermarkets small shops thank you
in my opinion the advantages of studying in second languages will be that you can improve that language so that you can learn more about the language and start to talk with other people and get good curriculum for that
in my experience the most difficult to study in other country is you are so far from your family
in my experience the best way to know more about the local culture it 's integrate of they festivities and walking around the city go to the small markets so you can get more interesting about the local culture
personally i would say that it really helps to become independent because be far away of your parents teach you how to keep a home how to cook how to make money and other skills
in the holiday i like reading books
i do n't understand can you repeat the question please
because if they are working they wo n't study good and they are studying every day and every day in all moment because it is their future
to go airport you should take a car the bus or the train often you should go to check in your suitcase after you have to submit your documentation to the security you will have to wait and finally you will get on the plane often you should go to the check in your suitcase after you have to submit your documention to the security you will have to wait and finally you will get on the plane
i am not sure but i think the students have to use the technology for it 's very important for your studies
i think it 's very important facility learning modern because it is important for the students
today the pollution is very bad because there are a lot of cars and ships in the world and environment is more important to the earth and i care our planet
when i meet with my friends i like see or watch movies i 'm going to the cinema
my father is similar to me because he like football and a lot of sports with me how any father and he is tall with me and he is my family
in the future i would like out of europe for example i would like to london or england because here is so beautiful and i learnt other language how english
the advantage do fitness classes is to meet other people while you do sport and the second is to practise other sport that you do n't know and if you practise fitness classes these sports help you to concentrate concentration to study and i do n't found nothing disadvantage in my opinion to do sports in classes is very important to studying in schools or college
i 'm going to explain how honey is produced the first bees collect nectar from flowers then bees make honey from nectar in beehives and then beekeepers collect honey from beehives than they arrive at supermarkets
i think that a student choosing another country because they learn the language before and in the future they will meet other people
i think that students found difficult to studying in another country when they do not know this language before it 's difficult studying a second language
i agree with you because the student is becoming independent when they live in another country he or she be able to independent when he cooking or cleaning the flat
i am interesting in their countries and their cultures but mainly in their language
i like to spend my free time playing soccer watching many series and movies but what i like to do the most is sing it is what i love the most and i could do it all the time
i like to watch movies or read a lot in english but i think the best way is speaking with another person and practice practice all the time and this is the key for be better
i could like to learn to play any instrument as i said a few moments ago i like to sing and that combinate with any instrument i think it could be amazing for me
in my opinion i think it 's a great option a great idea only if you have the time and the school allows it because these activities are very difficult i think the part time jobs have a lot of advantage and maybe you have the enough money to go out with your friends go to the parties go to the movies or cinemas and maybe you can pay your gym but this have a lot of disadvantage because you do n't have enough time to do your homework to pay attention of your classes and you do n't have the time to study for your exams i think it 's very difficult
acid rain six steps happen two acid particles are in the smoke and then these particles goes to the sky and in the third step acid particles are carried by wind four some acid particles fall as dust number five other acid particles mix with cloud water and then the final step six acid particles are in rain or snow and this damage to environment
in addition to hydrating you we need water because our body needs a lot of water to perform various functions for example blood contains a lot of water and that water carries oxygen throughout our body to the cells
not every day but it 's very important that you do a lot of exercise because it 's healthy and your body needs this exercise to be healthy and that 's all
but if you sleep a little more it will not affect much and everybody is different but sleeping eight hours will surely help your health
as everything it has it good and bad things unfortunately now the negative side is affecting us but if you know how to use technology it can help you to be healthier you can watch videos or even apps will help you have a healthy life
it is a beautiful place there are a park and near there are the schools and beautiful lakes with birds
in holidays i enjoy go to the beach and go to paris with my friends i love to travel and meet new peoples
i would be a broker to sells house and i wanna be rich in my future
in my opinion advantage that could have work is that you can pay your own things you can buy clothes you can buy eats you can buy everything that you want if you do n't have a job your parents should pay you everything and i think that if you want be a old person a good person you must be independent from your parents i work since i have twelve years old and in my opinion is very important work
ok when you travel by airplane you have to know that you must go to the airport in car autobus or train after arriving to the airport you must know that have to do a check in and after the check in you pass a control by a police and you must have your document
i think that the students can use the new technologies to study best using computer using mobile phones because they can consult everything in his mobiles
work in group projects can be a good solution to do best things every people can learn you to do new things
in my opinion is bad because you do n't focus in the text i prefer read my own paragraph and try to thinks how are the text
to the university have to try that every student learn well and do his course well

when student choose a country to study abroad first they should think about how to study and what is the aim of study so to think about that they can choose the country that is the best for study

well nowadays is very common that students should get jobs to pay for the university studies but is difficult because this have advantage and disadvantage for example one advantage could be they have money for shop their own things and they can spend the money in her things but have a disadvantage also for example they have to combine the job and study and in some cases or is very difficult to combine these also they have n't any free time and so it 's difficult for a young person
yeah i agree with you
yeah i think attending lectures is best or is better than reading alone because you can learn the mistakes of another persons and you also practice your pronunciation and you learn to read good
firstly the other culture is a very important part to make interest me secondly i will make new friends in other country

the students consider choosing a country they should consider the culture of the country because the culture is a very important point
studying a second language can help people to make friends with other countries ' people and they also can discuss complex question with their professor
firstly they will feel it is difficult to make friends with other countries ' people because the difference culture
i agree that because the students learning in the other country they need to do things by themself
i am superinteresting in learning about other countries because it 's very necessary in our life have knowledge about other cultures
i like to gather with my friends and drink some beers or maybe go to concerts with them and i really love read too
the best way for me is listening some videos cartoons or music and try to thinking in english
i like to sew because it permit me fabricate my own clothes so it 's really funny
i think that the life of the students is very funny because normally they met new people and they are very younger so they love party but in my opinion i think that the two things are good but always in a balance
the acid rain is provoked by the factories and vehicles that expel the pollution to the air then the acid particles are in smoke and they are blown to many parts of the atmosphere then the acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles fall as dust and they come to the earth other particle acid particles mix with cloud water and then the acid particles are in rain or snow and then they pour in the fields and damage to our environment
i advise them to eat a lot of proteins and follow a mediterranean diet because it 's the best of the health and it 's necessary of our health
i do n't think that it 's necessary doing exercise every day but for example doing three times per week is good and walk also
i think that sleep is so very important for our body and have a good habits and sleep eight hours per night it 's sufficient
it depends on the use of technology in many cases it 's good for our health because it help us
it 's very very very very very very good
this is my opinion
to travel by plane first you go to the airport and check in and you must have a document control and security and you ca n't wait eating in the airport when the avion it is in the airport it is very very important that you have a document controls because it is necessary
the technology it 's very very important for the student because now in this times everybody use the technology for looking for questions
i think it is very good because the student they are ask all the questions that they are now in this momment
my favourite time is autumn because autumn is a very comfortable season in this season is not very hot or very cold and the fruits is very delicious in autumn
i think read news every day is very important we need to understand what happens in our surrounding every day and it 's a most important that we can prepare everything in advance
when i was child i would n't have many work or study need i to do is i just need to have fun
my master degree is environment management so maybe in the future i will choose a job about my major and i think environment is very important in our daily life and this career is very useful
i think this topic both have advantages as disadvantages speaking for advantages maybe university students can get more work experience through the practice work process but students did n't have too much time to work in the university because students in the university maybe the most important task is study they need to focus on their classes to get more profession knowledge about their major so maybe sometimes they ca n't balance the time of study and working so in my opinion i think maybe some university classes can include some practice work experience but not all of them
this graph giving some information about the numbers of people visiting the site during their first week online and there have three online pop music sites the red one is tunes net and the blue one is music now the yellow one is songs for you and in this diagram we can see that the red one tunes net is increased in these seven day and the blue and yellow one that music now and the songs for you is reduced in this four day
i think the most important factor is to have patient because we need to cooperation with everyone in this team so we need to have patient to work with other and listen others ' require and ask their question
i think in a small team maybe we do n't have many person we can talk so maybe we ca n't create many interesting idea or listen other opinion is a disadvantages in a small team
yes maybe face to face is more effective than online meeting so maybe online is more effective than the face to face form
maybe teamwork it have a better results than working alone because in a team we have many peoples so maybe sometimes we can get more information and creative interesting idea in a team
well if i have to being honest i have to say that i 'm not really interest in the environment that 's probably due to the fact that i 'm afraid of all the animals and so i 'm not really correlated to that kind of things
we are really into hanging out but also we absolutely love staying at home and watching movie or t v series while eating some pizza and drinking beers or coca cola
that 's a nice question i mean i can not decide which person of my family is more similar to me that 's probably due to the fact that i am similar from different aspect to different person in my family
doing some sport at school it 's really important in italy every school have at least one hour of gym at school obviously the advantages are related to our healthy and the disadvantages as correlated to the fact that some people could agree that sport is n't as important as the culture math and so on as far as i 'm concern it 's important to have some sport class at school because it also help students to wind down their mind so to stop thinking for at least one hour and to relax more if sport is a relax at all
after being produce the honey is being transported in the supermarket and the outlet to be sold
for made up their mind about the country where to go they should consider the fact that they have to speak with other people in that country so they have to learn that language and also maybe to attend a course to learn that language better
well there are plenty of cons on knowing another language first of all it could be really useful for your future working life in fact for example it is really a surplus when you know another language in a c v
well there are great amount of difficulties that a students can find for example the fact that you have to talk with other people so at the beginning it will be really difficult to understand them and to approach with them
well i 'd say that the best way is to interact with people from that country obviously spending time with them can help you to learn their habits and also about their country also their eating habits
i 'd say so yeah absolutely as living in another country will help you to become much more independent because you can not count on your family and you will have to do everything alone
i am very interested because you can learn about their cultures and how people are and i think it 's important
in my free time i like doing some exercise i like watching t v shows listening to music or maybe reading books because i love it
well i reckon that the advantage would be that you can earn money and you can pay your studies you can developed some skills that could help you in the future and maybe you can put it that works on c v mainly the disadvantage could be that you ca n't spend your time studying i mean you have less time to study or doing homework well i think that it could be a good idea work
and because of that many particles and toxins are liberated to the atmosphere and this is too bad for the environment because some of these particles and toxins mix with cloud water and others can fall as dust but those that mix with cloud water then fall in rain
first of all you need to know that this is good for you and think about like a fun activity
because our body is make of water we need to drink water for ourselves and this is good because we feel more healthy
negative effect because this is something stressful for us and make that anyone moves and go out to the street
very much interested in learning other countries ' cultures after graduating high school in japan i moved to the u k spent one year then went to irish university for four years now i 'm in the u s so i learnt a lot about different cultures

i would like to learn how to cut and cook fishes because now i started fishing as a new hobby and if you can you know cut and cook fishes and it 's great
i do not agree with the statement that all university student should do some part time jobs there is an advantage of doing a part time job as a student obviously you can learn how to earn money and obviously as a student you need to spend a lot of money on tuition fees and your daily lives but on the other hand you have to balance your time you have to study in the library if you 're a student the main thing you 've got to do is studying so if enough money and your focus is on studying a subject you do not have to do apartment job so this is the reason why i do not agree with the sentence
so here 's how acid rain is caused and eventually damaged environment first of all acid particles are created via emission of pollution from factories and vehicles and any other sources and then acid particles as smoke go up in the air and within that air acid particles are carried by wind and it forms cloud some acid directly falls to the ground and damage the soils or ponds river ocean
i think a good eating habit is eating breakfast lunch and dinner at the same time every day and not eating too many sweets and alcohols
i think it is extremely important to drink water regularly instead of drinking only coffees or alcohol and sugary beverages because it dehydrates your body
it 's not essential to do exercise every single day but it is important to do some exercise it depends on your age your gender and what level of healthiness you 're looking for but certainly doing exercise is good for you
i do not necessarily agree that every single person need eight hours of sleep every day on average it would be good to have eight hours ' sleep but again depending on a person he may only need six hours
i see environment as a pretty serious issue coz nowadays people tend to create a lot of waste so normally when i go out i bring my own bottle own container for food et cetera
me and my friends enjoying going for a window shopping finding nice dining restaurants for supper and as well as go to a cinema to enjoy a movie
in my family i 'm most similar to my mother she is the one who always takes cares of me and pays all my tuition fees for the school and she always took me out when she has some event
i 'm currently living in taipei because of the work i used to do here
there are some pros and cons if schools and colleges make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes the negative points the disadvantages are the students may get too tired after the exercise and they will become very sweaty in the way that the classroom will fill with bad smells on the other hand the advantages are the students may be able to keep fit and to be more able to focused on what they are learning coz there 's a study saying that exercise can help people to get focused and they will become effective learners
today 's presentation is about how honey is produced there are six steps of it and it 's from the flower to shop so first of all the bees have to collect nectar from the flowers after that they will make honey from nectar in beehives after making the honey the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then put it into the jar after that the jars will be shipped to the supermarkets or the stores that sells the honey and in the end the customers will get the honey from the supermarket
when choosing a country to study in students should consider about the culture first whether it suits their preferences and secondly it 's the weather
students may find it difficult about the culture when they study in another country because different country have different cultures it might be extremely opposite from their home country so they need time to adapt
students can learn about the local culture by making some local friends in the country like this they can all hang out together in a way that they can experience the local culture
i think studying abroad indeed helps students to become more independent as for me i used to study abroad for a year and that makes me more important because i have to do everything on my own including cooking
i love learning about new countries new languages new cultures because i think that the more you know about new societies different societies and new ways of thinking the better person you can become
i used to have a dog and then i used to love taking him to parks or for walks he passed away and nowadays i like to read and watch t v series and movies
practicing especially with a demanding teacher who corrects me all the time and helps me improve my pronunciation and grammar and going to school and studying studying and studying
it would be dancing because i think it 's a great job it 's relaxing and it would also improve my self confidence
all university students should do part time jobs while they 're studying in my opinion this should be optional for the students because on the one hand the ones who do n't work would have the opportunity to check how real life works and put into practice the theory they learn in class on the other hand for those who already worked for self support or to support their families it would be a great disadvantage because they would n't be able to leave their real jobs and look for something that may not be rewarding in question of money i 've been through this situation and it was really exhausting most teachers do n't understand that you do have to work to support yourself
all the pollution caused by vehicles and factories are the ones that cause the acidive rain so the government should be more demanding with the factories in order to avoid this problem
first of all i think people should cut down on sugar salt and processed food and as a vegetarian i would also suggest people to reduce or cut totally down as much as red meat as possible
it is extremely important as long as you respect your body remember two litres maybe too much for a person who weighs fifty kilos but be too little for a person who weighs a hundred kilos so you should always talk to a doctor
i think it is essential to do exercise and the question about being every day depends on a person 's habits
well i personally disagree because i need nine hours of sleep but some people do well on seven hours
this is a tricky question because it depends on how people deal with technology on the one hand it can be good because you can research about good ways better ways of life but on the other hand it can be bad because people are spending too much time in front of screen
currently i live in london which is the largest city in united kingdom it is a very beautiful but it 's really noisy as well
when i 'm on holiday i like to practice my hobbies
i really enjoy spending time with my sister she is younger than me and she is amazing she is not only very funny she 's also very intelligent and very amazing
however when i moved to london i realise how much i love fashion
so basically i strongly believe that to get job to earn some money to invest on pay you university is a very good idea the advantage is that you are going to be independent economic independent of your parents and the disadvantage could be that you wo n't have a lot of time to have a great time to your friend and also maybe you wo n't have a lot of time to study however my opinion is that if you want to get a very good future you need to do that so i strongly believe that is a very good idea
basically first at all you need to arrive to the airport so you must to take a car bus or train the best option is a train because it 's very fast in addition when you arrive to the airport you need to do the check in so you must to wear your passport with you then you need to go to the document control and you need to show your passport and your ticket then you need to pass for the security control and then you need to wait until the hour of the department then you need to go abroad and then the plane is going to run off
when students are working on group projects together they are learning to be good on teamworks which is a very important skill

i like to spending time my free time with my sister because is the same age as me and we like enjoy different afternoons playing football in the garden
in the future i would like to have a job relationship with my degree as an engineer of industrial technology
in my opinion i strongly believe that not all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies because there are some students that can afford their university studies for example whereas the main advantage is earn money but the drawback is the time that waste for working as their job
this diagram show the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane before landing you must check in your document control and you will pass the security control next you have some time to wait in the airport doing some shopping or going to toilet or a coffee centre when needs a time you board to the plane and next finally you landed
yes i reckon that face to face is the best way to learn but nowadays technology improves allow students to study with online
in my opinion i do n't think that attending lectures is better than reading alone because reading alone you improve yourself
it 's so important for university learning facilities because the students in the university have some of them part time jobs and they do n't have enough time to go to a classroom
place where i live calls murcia it 's a region of the south of spain

nowaday have a part time job when you are studying in university is more frequently this have advantations and disadvantations part of this advantations is the experience of be part of a teamwork but some disadvantations is that is complicated to coordinate the university studies and the part time job my opinion this is so important and you needs to be this work
well travel is one of the first thing i want to do first you have to go to the airport this is so important be in time so you have to choose the best option to arrive at the airport
nowaday technology is more important in the life so this is the key the first key to improve your knowledge
my opinion is the best way to improve your knowledge have a teacher face to face
you always can learn about others
i prefer reading alone in my opinion but other people prefer attending lectures because it 's the way to be concentrated and is more effective for them
in my free time i like watching t v reading playing with my son doing sport but my favourite hobby is photography i love photography
in my opinion the best way for improve my english is speaking with english people or watching movie or t v in english
i would like play the guitar or any instrument i think is very beautiful
this a very interesting topic personally i think the advantages are the students will be more responsible and they would learn a job and the disadvantage i think the study have less time for study but in my opinion i think have more advantages than disadvantages
i go to speak about acid rain first of all the factory are working and the pollution have a lot the acid particle and the smoke and these acid particular are carried by the wind
the best way for eating healthily is do n't eat fast food
i think the people have drink eight quarter glass all day ok two liters
i do n't think is necessary to exercise every day i think is better twos a week
from my opinion of view i think that 's great sleep eight hour a day
and yet for me it 's more important the eat of the countries
jolly i enjoy spending my free time in the cinema for example with my friends or go to the beach with my family or walking with my dogs
i think that the best way to improve my english is go to the other country where speak english and pass a long time and work in this country
i could learn i do n't know i think i am very happy if i can fly
for one part one advantage is that the students can win money it is a best part for you can spend the money in your matrical of the university or in other course or other things
acid rains begin to form when moisture in the air combines with acid particles emitted by factories and vehicles after the acid particles are carried by the wind and other acid particles mix with the cloud water and precipitate in rain or snow form it depend and this had damage much to environment because the pollution in these particles is very very bad and corrosive for all planet
in my opinion having good eating habits it 's very important to improve your health
i think that drink water is very important because the water serves for clean your body and the experts recommend drink two litres for a day
in my opinion exercising is essential to have a good quality of life it may not be necessary to practice it every day although if you have the time and desire that is fine
i believe that children have to sleep more than adults but for a teenager or an adult it is appropriate to sleep eight hours a day
i think it has its pros and cons but for me the advantages are more important since thanks to technology a great advance have been made though history and help us improve our quality of life
yes i love the environment so much and i can find many students walking around the campus
me and my friends enjoy doing watching movies together so that we can discuss about the heros and heroines and we can talk about the scenes in the movies
i am most similar to my older sister because our height is about the same and also our appearance is about the same we wear glasses
in the future i would like to live in the urban area because in the urban area there are less air pollution because they are less of cars and transportation and in the urban area there are more peaceful and there 're more quiet
fitness classes in school day may bring advantages or disadvantages to the students and then the other advantage for student join the fitness class is that they may learn the different exercises in the fitness classes however there are some disadvantages where the student may not focus in their class and then this will cause them to have lesser time to do their study
the diagrams shows how the honey is produced from the flower to shop first the bees will collect the nectar from the flowers and then the bees will make the honey that they collected from nectar in their beehives after that the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then the honey will be produce and process and package into the packaging which normally will be a bottle after the honey is well package the honey will be sent or deliver to the shop
when the students choosing a country for studying they must consider about the cost of learning and also the cost of living as well because if the cost of living is very expensive their parents may not afford to pay for it
the advantage of studying in the second language is that the students may have more advantage to get a new job in the future because they know like more than one language
studying in another country i think that the student may face some difficulties such as they may not able to communicate well with the local people because of the language
when the student is studying in another country i think the students can learn the local culture by joining the activities of the local people
yes i agree that students studying abroad can become independent because when they are in another country they may have to adapt to the environment and stuff and if they have any troubles they have to solve on their own
my favourite time of the year is the winter because i like feel the cold in my face and i love the winter clothes
i like to be informed of what is happening around me that 's why i used to watch the news every day i think is very important to know how your country is doing
i come from a large family so i used to spend my free time playing with my brothers and sisters on a weekend we used to go to our house in the village
in the future i would like to have enough money to travel with my family around the world i would love to visit a different country every year
starting work before you finish your studies is an opportunity to improve your skills and to be in contact with the real world maybe spend your studies time working may be bad for you because you spend your time working even studying in my opinion is a very good idea because i think is important to be in contact with the laboral world
at the pictures we can see the progress of three new online pop music site we can see that music now has risen since the first day till the third day
sometime it 's good to be in disaccording because you can improve your ideas and maybe it make you to be better
it 's possible than there are people who do n't like works on team
i am very interesting about learning other countries and i try to know more about them
well i enjoy going for a walk with my family reading or watching movies specially serials i like studying english practicing it in different ways
the best way for me to improve my english is practicing it practicing speaking with somebody watching movies and reading
if you mean a new skill it is something absolutely new for me i would try a new kind of sport
well advantages for university students when they do part time jobs are obvious students study how to communicate with other people how to work in team for example also they have their pocket money maybe not pocket and they are able to pay back their student loan there are also some disadvantages although these are unability to have much free time for entertainment difficulties to find enough time to study and maybe tidiness my own opinion it 's very good when students can work
there is a big problem for our nature with acid rains there is a natural cycle of making this phenomenon vehicles and factories and also planes and other means of transport they make a lot of fumes which goes to atmosphere they form pollutions which consists from acid particles with the smoke acid particles goes into the atmosphere by the wind and some of them are going down at the ground as a dust rain or snow
i would recommend to eat more fruits and vegetables and also food rich of carbohydrates and proteins and all food should be fresh
i think that drinking lots of water is very important for everybody because our body consists mainly from water and all processes in our body are unable to be without water
i think it 's essential to do exercises every day because in this way a person can keep their fit and be in a good station
well i agree with the opinion that people have to sleep at least eight hours a day not less but maybe somebody needs more sleeping
technology may give positive and negative effects and it depends on different circumstances when finding the information is important thing it 's preferably to use computer but it 's not too much

i love to check and see new places i love to go around and do the bicycle hiking running around the parks looking to the nature with my family
i 'd like to have a job where i can use all my capacities and skills i would prefer a job in an office where i can sit from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon so after that i could have some quality time with my family doing things together maybe eating food together
we are going to talk about if students should get jobs while they are doing their university studies we know that everybody is going to get jobs because of the money the money is always good to have but considering that the time you have to invest for working is the time you will take out from the university classes and i think you should be focusing especially when you are at school where you have a lot of more freedom in what is important and what is important in that time is that you have to sit and listen to your teachers and learn and go deep and research investigate not only focusing in the money in that short period of time
hello today i 'm going to teach you how to travelling by an airplane to be able to take an airplane first you need to take transportation to get to the place called airport the airport is the place where the airplanes go out when you are at the airport you need to go and do the check in with an assistant after the assistant has checked that you have the right place then you need to pass on to the document control where the policeman is going to ask you about your passport to checking that you have to the right name on it after that then you have to wait to be called to get on board of the airplane in order one to one
to study more effectively students can use the technology of their smartphones for example there they can do calendars where they can write it down all they have to do during all the day the weeks and the month
a face to face class is equally the same as having online because with the use of the new technologies you can talk directly to your teacher through your computer so for me it does n't make any difference between doing make it face to face or online classes
also you can ask for question to your partner that maybe you did n't listen before and you can get help from them with the organisation of the work
because when you go and see your teacher speaking about the subject then you can get more attention into details he can explain a little bit further there is easier to understand
facilities provided by the university are basics nowadays because with the use of the technology we can improve our research for example if you need to buy a book or you need to read about some interesting topic then you can go and sit on the computer and get it right away
i am very interested in environment and also i am worried because people use a lot of plastics and we are n't concerned about this
well we love go to the cinema in summer go to the beach but the summer is a little different but we love go out together and go running or other sports this is all
maybe physically it 's my mother but in personality probably my brother or my father because my father is more relaxed and more independent and me too
well in my opinion the advantage of doing fitness classes in the school time is that all students can practice a sport and so they are more healthy and the disadvantage is that in the school they need to reduce the time of other subjects maybe maths or maybe language or i do n't know but need to reduce another subject in my opinion it 's a good idea because children and teenagers usually do n't practise sport and it 's very important for their health so it 's a good idea
in the picture i can see a diagram about honey and how honey comes to the flowers and goes to the shop well first bees collect nectar from the flowers and they make honey from nectar in the beehives later the beekeepers who is the person who collect the honey collect the honey and put in the tub
i imagine they will consider the language of the country the universities that there are in the country the culture
the main advantage of studying in a second language is that you can improve your language maybe if it is english you can improve your english and you can meet person in this country
the most obviously difficult is if you are in a country that do n't speak your language you need to speak in this idiom so this is difficult
speak with local people go to the concert festivals go to the cinema and listen films in this language
yes i agree with this because when you travel alone and live alone in a different country you need to make things alone
my favourite time of year is christmas
for me is not important to read or listen news
i spend my free time when i was child riding bike
i would like to be in the future a manager
i would like to start saying the advantage in my opinion this kind of measures assure that the students acquire the skills that they will need in their futures work in my opinion must be a compromise between the study and practical time for taking the best of the work
we can see during the first of all days all of them started and maintained the same number of visit each one the most successfully was music now which start around seventy visits the first day increase its visits number till one hundred and ten the third day maintaining this fabulous number of visits three days and then and it fall down until eighty visit the seventh day with songs four you we see the opposite that successful because it started with a similar number that music now only a few visits less that music now around sixty per day maintaining this is numbers for five days until the big fall the sixth and the seventh
if the leader is honestly all the people work really good
i do n't agree with this because the team leader must be encouraged if they are encouraged the team follow them wherever they go to
i think that not because some things in the actuality are working in remote and this is perfect for some kind of works because not all people need to stay together for work good
depend because some task is better that only one person developed it if this person know exactly how to do is perfect for one person only
my favourite time of the year it is maybe when summer arrives in the town and i love to go to the beach i love clothes like to put in a dress
it 's necessary to get well known what is going on in your city and your country
i used to spend time on my neighbourhood with the other children and we played games like football or something
i hope i will be working on something relative to human resources that gives me time to travel and maybe buy a camper and see spain
also enables a student to develop their skills on the other hand we have the disadvantage it could be that the internship are not well paid in my own opinion i think it 's a good idea to be a trainee in some company and learn about real problems and also work in a team and have a boss who show you how to do things
the past week has been launched three new online pop music site in this graph we can see that music now is the online pop music site that had the most increase of visitors in the weekend followed by songs four you
for me a good team leader should be empathic with other people get always ready to fix any problem quickly and keep the team united to have one direction
work with small teams has problem like people get overwhelmed by the amount of work maybe they do n't get along between companions and also they can get tired to do always the same task
absolutely but is good to express your ideas and know each other is basic to work in a team
no totally but i think it 's better face to face than for example by email or video conference and that 's because you can misunderstood on this ways and that 's why i prefer face to face
from my point of view i agree with this people who think that there is better result working in a team that 's because everyone have faults maybe in a team there is someone who can fill with other skills
it is located in the north of china and it 's also a coastal city with beautiful sceneries there are many beautiful beaches in my hometown if you got time you have to get there and relax yourself
i enjoying playing video games with my buddies and when it is sunny days we often have a barbecue in a park and then go to the night club if it is rainy days we often watch movies at home like a couch potato
it should be my mom because my mom is a mathematical teachers and i 'm very interested in math so we often study together and when i in a bad mood she often helps me to and give me a comfort so i appreciate her most
it would be a bit to become a maths teacher because i 'm very interested in math and i am more than interesting to talk about with others in math and i really enjoying the satisfaction that teaching other knowledge brings me
what 's more it can help them to improve their communicative skills it helps them to know how to communicate with the people around them but the disadvantage is that maybe part time jobs will takes their time too much that they would n't concentrate on their study so in my opinion universities should balance their time on part time jobs and their studies
here is an illustrating about how to travel by a plane first travel to airport by bus by taxi or by train and after you arrive the airport you have to check in make sure you have all the i d cards certificates visa and so on after that and then you have to have your document controlled if you finished these steps then you will have security check and then you have to wait for a while after that when your flight is going to take off you got ta abroad and then just enjoying your flight
by surfing some educational website students can acquire a lot of useful educational informations and it can help them enhance their educational skills and help them to get a high score
i agree with that when you will have lessons face to face with teachers you will be more focused on your study and you would like to communicate with your teachers about some questions he can help you freely any time
it can help them to develop cooperative skills and the communicative skills and the organisation skills
i think attending lectures would be a better because the professor and advisor will help you to point out your further study direction and they can help you to relax your stress from made by study or something
modern learning facilities could bring advanced knowledge around the world and students can use it for relaxation or of some useful information from the internet so i think it 's very important
i believe that learning about other countries and their culture is very important since i am a teacher i consider to be really important because in this way you know the people and how they work
most of my free time i spend it with my family with my wife my son and sometimes my parents we have to have a nice night drinking a beer and maybe eating some pizza
from my perspective the best way to improve your english is to use it in a real way for example speaking with people whose first language is english for example i also like to use speak and improve
i do n't consider myself a good speaker in front of people
having a part time job during our university studies can bring some advantages and some disadvantages a disadvantage could be that you can have less time to do your homework for example an advantage could be that if your part time job is related to the career then it will help you because you will apply what you are learning in the university and if it does n't work you can learn from that experience so in my opinion it 's very important for students to have a part time job however this part time job must be related to their bachelor degrees so it will learn more
it is well known that rain is a natural phenomena however factories and vehicles produce pollution and this pollution is mainly acid particles in smoke and these particles are carried by the wind and some particles falls as dust on the other hand there 're other particles that mix with the clouds and these clouds producing water or snow make fall this acid particles over the trees over the animals even over of our cars and this can be harmful and it damages the nature
since our bodies are conformed of ninety six percent of water it 's very important that we drink water however as you said before drinking lots of water maybe can be very harmful
maybe doing exercise every day can be excessive if you are a beginner in this field however maybe three days per week can be very effective if you want to have a healthy life and then you can go on and work harder
in my own perspective i consider that it depends on the person i sleep eight hours and that 's enough for me however there are other people who needs ten hours and there are other people who needs just six hours and they are done
i consider that technology indeed affect us however i believe that it will affect you more the more you use it
the place where i live it 's really quiet at surrounding village and you have the possibility to go to the centre of the city but you do n't live there
well i enjoy travelling that 's the best activity that i can do when i am on holidays
i enjoy spending time with my sister because we can do a lot of physical activities and well we have the same interests
in the future i would like to work as a teacher because i study to be teacher and i really like to be teacher in public education in spain
well i think university students want to pay their own studies because it 's really difficult for families to get the amount of the money that you need to pay your studies so the advantage well you are independent of your family and are economically independent the disadvantages are obviously you have less time to study so that 's not good for your degree in my opinion for me it 's more important the independence and not to be a charge for your family so you need to have a job and be able to pay your own studies
first of all you have to travel to the airport so you could do this travel by train on a bus or by car well when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and show your documentation because it 's necessary to leave the country well you have to to pass the security control and then you have to wait
they are tools to
it depends because in some occasions when you attending lectures you learn a lot because the teacher it 's good at his job but in other locations attending lectures is not effective because it 's the same that you read alone
it 's important because the way that the students learn is changing all the time so that 's important to modernise your style of teach to be attractive for the students
i am interested in learning about foreign cultures
i enjoy my free time playing baseball or travelling
i think the best way to improve my english skill is to communicate with foreign people in english
one of the advantage to do part time jobs is to learn about society but one of the disadvantage is to lose study in university so i think all university students should do part time jobs
first the smoke of pollution is emitted by vehicles and factories then the acid particles are in smoke are carried by window then some acid particles fall as dust in the ground and other acid particles mix with cloud water then acid particles are in rain or snow fall to the ground then they damage to environment
you can eat breakfast because it 's best it 's most important eating
it is important to drink water because drinking water makes us so healthy
i think it is important to do exercise every day because doing exercise makes me so healthy and ok
i live in gran canaria a fantastic island with one of the best weather of the world here apart of beach we have fantastic mountains and people here as wonderful
when i 'm on holiday for me it 's essential relax me but always as i can i love travelling and discover new place in the world with my family and friend
of all my family i think the person who i have best moment is with my mother because we are pretty similar in the way that we speak
i would like to work in the receptions so for it i 'm learning language because it 's essential for this type of work and other good thing of this work is you meet with people from all over the world
not all the students have enough money to pay they needs during university one advantage of get a jot is that they can have the enough money to buy the things they need during all the course they do n't have to worry about how make ends meet on the other side disadvantage it could be that they do n't have the same time to study like other student that do n't need a job
for go to the airport you have to choose one option you can go by car by bus or by train when you arrive at the airport do n't forget to do the check in in the main desk after that you can pass the document control and the security control after all this you can wait in the room there you can find toilets and shops and you can eat because there are a wide variety of restaurants when you see on the board the time of your travel you enter in the airplane and here we go you can fly
if there are lot of webspace where you can find free course
from from my point of view it 's a good way a really good way but no is the only if you have english friends for instance you can speak with him and it 's really good too
i think work in group is a good option because every member of the group can help each other and they can collaborate between they
i do n't know i do n't be really sure but say i think that reading is very good to improve your vocabulary and your writing
i believe if very important because if you have lot of facility for the students they can choose the best way to learning and improve their language
yes of course i mean i live in a neighborhood near to the city centre and here we can find everything shops blah blah blah blah blah
when i 'm on holiday i love to travel with my family if we can to foreign countries and visit museums eat in different restaurants
i most enjoy having time with my mother because she is very funny and she always has lots of stories to tell me about my infancy about my teenager so i have a good time with her
in the future i would like to be a teacher an english teacher because i love being with young people and i love to teach languages to anyone that 's what i do
do n't you see that student should get jobs to pay for their university studies i absolutely agree that we have a lot of advantages for students by getting a job they can experiment what a real job is and that practice will help them to choose a good job for the future it could also have some disadvantages so having a job while you 're studying can rest you time from studying so you may have less free time so you can know what the job life is
this diagram shows the steps you have to follow when travelling by plane first of all you have to travel to the airport you can do it by bus by train or by car and when you arrive to the airport you have to do the check in pass through the document control and pass through the security control at last you do the boarding then you are into the plane and then you only have to wait till the plane takes off
i think there are lots of options for students to use technology to study more effective they can be gadgets computer programs mobile phones social networks
also you can see how his body moves
i think the most important thing that they can learn in group projects is communication communication is very important in all types of jobs so it could be a good thing them to learn that 's what i think
i think that attending lectures can be more effective than reading alone because you have to pay more attention to the person who is doing the lecture so i think that concentration will help you a lot
i think it is very important for universities to provide learning facilities to students i think that 's very important
when i meet with my friends we like to go to the beach go to movies or go to eating at some restaurant
when i graduate i would like to move to united states because the job opportunities are better than in mexico
the disadvantage are the cost i think
the bees is one of the most important animal for the human existence and also they produce the honey that is a product that the humans consume first the bees collect nectar from flowers then they make honey from nectar in beehives and people that are in charge to collect the honey from beehives are the beekeepers and then they sell to the stores for the human consume
i think the most important thing to consider is the country where you can develop professionally and you can learn about your career
i think that there are many advantage or learning a second a thirdly a fourly language because it 's important for the develop of your career and your person
i think the most difficult thing is be far away from your country
there are many ways to learn about the other countries but the best way is making friends that was from there
i think that it could be possible but also can depends of the students and their habits
there are a lot of things to see and do
two or three years ago when i was on holidays always i tried to travel my favourite place is the north of spain but right now with the coronavirus it 's impossible to travel anywhere so i 'm the time in my house
i spend more time always with my daughter because she is not going to the school for the coronavirus at the moment so she is with me twenty four hours a day we go together to every places
right now i am studying for a position to work for the government so for me the perfect work have that i want to work for the government to have stability and a good schedule only in the mornings
the advantages it could be that the job gives them a chance to put in practice skills they have learned in school the part time have disadvantages because the students could feel tired and do n't enough time to study while doing part time work in my opinion is necessary to keep in mind the importance of a good balance between school work and part time jobs i 'd rather study first and then work only on vacation in summer
in the diagram i can see how you have to go changing in the airport to travelling by airplanes the first thing to travel to the airport is taking a bus or trailway or in a car just there you can park the car or you can down of the bus and go to the exit way later you have to check in your luggages or if you have hand luggage is not necessary check in anything then later you have to pass the document control with the police and the security later you have to wait
the use of technological tools motivates and makes it easier for students to hold they attention to be more effectivility they could be funnier learning technology
i think it 's better face to face than online classes because when you are with a teacher in front on you it 's better the concentration and you can learn better
they could separate the projects for example if they are three they can do it apart for each one
in my opinion it 's better reading alone than attending lectures with more people because when you are alone the concentration is bigger than in a group so for me it 's better read alone
i really love to learn about more countries and specific more about europe their culture about their food about their language about almost everything i think that it 's very interest to know about their history
to be honest i do n't have like a lot of free time however if i have some hours or some minutes i spend it like cooking some cakes and also doing some exercise
the best way to improve my english is not by studying if not by practicing speaking with other people and also watching series in netflix in english
if i could learn another skill maybe i will choose learning french and german this is because the entire world well almost the entire world speaks those languages
as we can know there are many students that also have a part time job part time jobs have advantages and disadvantages but first advantages we can see that people who make internships can make a little more of mistakes than full time job workers however in the part of disadvantages the people who may have a part time job are not very concentrated on the job or in the school
the process begin with factories and vehicles spreading pollution then it transformed to acid particles in smoke the wind is carrying some acid particles for all the environment but some acid particles fall as dust however other acid particles mix with cloud water finally acid particles are in rain or snow this give us a lot of damage to environment and it 's bad for our health
in my opinion it 's essential to go to a nutriologist they will give you a diet for your body and with this you can improve your eating habits
i think that a good recommendation to drink more water is have a big bottle and if you will always carry with you to remember that you have to drink it
i think that it is not very essential doing exercise every day but often i recommend it this is not because about your weight it is because more about your health and we good habits
i think that it depends on each one i would recommend like at least six hours per day but if you can sleep the essential for you it is ok
i think that it depends on whether you need a technology
i am very interested in learning other countries because i love travelling and know other cultures and other people
in my free time i love go out with my dog and well i love walk with him and i love reading books too on the sofa because it relaxes me a lot
i think that the best things to improve my english is go abroad and practice with other people and i go to a english class twice a week for improve my english here
one things that worry people is the money when we are studying it 's common that we do n't have enough money and if we want to do a lot of thing with our friends a lot of student have a part time job to do at the same time that the university it have a lot of advantage for example they have more money they can work abroad but the disadvantage are for example they do n't have enough time for study their degree
factories and vehicles produce pollution acid particles are in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wind some of these acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water and then these acid particles are in rain or snow to sum up the acid rain damaged to environment
i think that it 's important to eat healthy and do n't eat for example fast food and the gras food and increase the vegetables in our diet
i think it 's very important to drink water because we have to be hydrated our body
i think that to do exercise is very important but not all the day it 's possible so we have to do exercise almost twice or three times a week
in my opinion technology is a bad way to relax because we have to disconnect in our free time
my favorite moment of a year is the summertime because i can enjoy of my free time and i can enjoy of my family
it is not very important because nowadays the news are bad and sad and i prefer read a book or watch a series
i hope be the best french teacher in a school i hope to do a project with my crafting manualities
this question is very interesting because young people is prepared to work in the moment when they finish their studies in this case it 's impossible because they have between twenty or twenty two years old for that reason this idea have so many advantages for young people and for the companies and they can determinate if they want continue with this work or not
hello as you look this graph show how much people are visiting three new online pop music site tunes net song four all and music now in the first one you can see that in the first day there were more people seeing music now between sixteen and eighteen thousand of people in the rest of day this music site music now is the winner reaching in first and fifth day between thousand and one thousand twenty of people that heard this site however in the seventh day there were more listener of tunes net reaching thousand of people
ok a good team leaders should be a person with character
yes i think each one can express their opinion of the project but this person must continue with a new idea
and in addition they can resolve problem that can be appear
i think it is true because each one can have different idea to do the project in the best way
this is a really small but cute town with a lot of young people there is also beach and the weather is pretty good
in my spare time i enjoying going out with my friend and going to the fairground because i am a thrill seeker i also enjoying playing basketball since i 've been played for ten years
i really enjoy spending time with my father because this is my best friend and we have a lot of things in common as basketball and also eating and doing some shoppings
my aim is to become a lawyer so i 'm working really hard for it because it 's my dream since i have six so yeah i want to work in law
the main advantage of working during your study to pay the university cost is the fact that that permits to student to have more responsibility and independence on the other hand a student can be less focused on course and it can be a bad thing for their grade but as far as i 'm concerned working can be a good solution for students who ca n't afford the price of a great university nevertheless when student has the choice i think that they should avoid working at the same time that they are studying
first of all you ca n't go to the airport by feet you need to take your car a bus or a train when you arrive at the airport you go to the check in and show your i d or your passport so people of the airport can verify your identity after that you pass a security guard and then you are at the waiting place there there is a lot of thing you can eat take a cafe and also buy some gifts for your family for example after that this is the boarding time and you get in the airplane then your travel can start
in they can use it for example for replacing the time they spent in library because it 's easy and real quick to find out the information you need in internet nowadays
as far as i 'm concerned you do n't need to be face to face and staring at people to learn for example today there is a virus and then everybody are on their own home and studying from there but the result is good too
everybody has to present his own point of views somehow
yeah sure because when you attending to lectures you are in the mood you are in good environment to learn and improve your skills
for me it 's not really important because what is important it 's the effort you put on your work every day because you need to improve you need to exercise
i live in madrid also it is a crowded city and i really enjoy its bustling streets and you can do many things there
i really enjoy going with my relatives to my mother 's village we all really get on well all together so we spend a really good time there
i most enjoy spending time with my mother i think we understand really well together and we get on well
my dream job is to set up my own business a social one and be my own boss and contract employees in order to get a work life balance because currently i do n't have it
as i see it all university student should work part time or even full time in order to be able to support by themselves or to be self sufficient so to sum up i have to say that as i see it working while studying it is a good way to gain experience and also maybe in the future they will be able to have a better paid job than if they did n't work
when travelling by airplane people and travellers should first they need to travel to the airport by their own way for example by their car or they can take an uber or a public bus after that they need to do the boarding pass and the security control and if they pass this they will have to wait to wait maybe for long time having lunch or shopping after that you need to do a long queue in order to board and then you have a seat that it is on your boarding document and after that the plane has take off and you need to turn off your devices and your mobile phone
and currently we have a wide range of possibilities and using technology for study needs where a good choices you can search on internet and you can share with your colleagues information
i 'm in totally agree with that point of view since if you learn face to face with your teacher and also with other students you will be able to ask if you have any doubt also you can speak with your teacher
they can develops a wide range of skills such as communication skills social skills loyalty for me most important one is communication and the only way to improve it it is speaking
well it depends on the kind of person you are if you have the ability of be concentrate at classes it would be for sure a better option than studying by their own however there are people that feel that they progress more at home
university facilities is the place where you are going to stay most of your time during your university studies
i really hate my town because it has no shops no cinemas hardly anything
well as i usually fail my final exams my summer holidays tends to start very late so when it comes by mid of july i really like to do nothing like stay in bed all day
well although it can sounds a little bit evil i really do n't like to spend so much time with any of my family because they can be so annoying sometimes so i prefer to stay alone or with my friend
so as a physic student i really like to work in the future probably in the nasa
well at one hand i think that it could be a really good option for student because by that they are gon na have experience so in future they can add it on their c vs so enterprise contract thems but on the other hand i think that a student if you are at university your main objective is to study and to get your degree and if you are working obviously you are n't gon na have the total time to dedicate to your career and probably you are gon na fail some subjects or anything like that
so if you 're gon na travel by airplane first of all you have to obviously go to the airport depending of the facilities of the city you could go by tram or train by bus or by your own or taxi or your own car so once there you have to go to your company gate and check your luggage then you have to pass the security control where a policeman control your passport and your i d and check your luggage when you pass the security control probably you have to wait in a waiting room or you can go to a cafe
for example i have an ipad so when i am not in the mood for being studied i would prefer to stay in bed but as i say i have to study i could bring my ipad to the bed and study my notes being warm in my bed
well obviously it depend of the teacher and the subject that are you studying but in my own experience i will say that i prefer a book rather than a teacher
so first of all if you work in groups you 'll have to deal with people so you could develop your empathy or sympathy skills being nice to other people
as i said earlier it would depend on the subject on my own experience it 's preferable to read a book alone because most of my teacher are unexperience teaching students
well in my opinion it is a very important matter
it 's so beautiful in my opinion we have a castle a big castle we have a great food drink
i really like travelling is my main hobby i think i try to find the best prices the best offer to travel and i always travel once for my holiday
i prefer stay with my brother because we have a lot of things on common and he 's very funny in my opinion like me and yeah i love this boy
yeah i studied chemistry i 'm chemist and i would like something about chemist but try to research something important and something about environment
my opinion the main advantage about get jobs to pay your university studies is you can help your family to pay these studies your parents ca n't support all the cost of studies usually at least in spain the main disadvantage is the time it difficult to have the same qualification the same marks with a job
okay first you have to travel to airport then in the airport you should look for staff to do the check in then when you do the check in and you passed the document control and the security you are ok to board in the aeroplane so if you have time you could wait and take a coffee or buy a gift then you board and start your journey enjoy
in my opinion technology could be very useful for students because they want to use application on mobile phone or the laptop to improve their way to study
but nowadays maybe with technology is enough in a lot of ways to learn
student could acquire a lot of skill because you need work in a group in your daily life
my opinion i prefer to read all alone because is better for concentrating i think in my opinion attending lecture could be a lot of distraction for the students
i think it 's very important learning facilities for student because the university is like one door to the real life and they need a lot of facilities to work and to life
i love the traditions and different cultures and i 'm so interesting in that and i think it 's so so very clever to know about the other countries i want that
i love watch series on netflix or prime video and anyways i love playing or staying with my family too play with my dog getting out with my friends i love to have a good time
i think listening listening to music in english listening to series i love to watch series in english because it 's the original language and reading a lot in english books or something like that
and i would like to have friendship with all the people on this world
so we know that the pollution the air pollutions comes from factories and vehicles so this pollution go up and make acid particles that are in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wind and that makes that they could mix with other particles and some acid particles fall as dust in the world so acid particles are in rain snow normally and that provokes the damage to environment
first of all they should drink a lot of water it 's too important and eat a lot of fruits it 's so important because these fruits have the proteins and vitamins that our body needs
it 's very good to do exercise every day a little bit but you have to have a routine and do a little bit for example fifteen minutes per day it 's good
well i think so i think that it is very important to sleep because sleeping makes you feel better makes you feel your body with more energy and that 's so important
obviously a negative because maybe some people for your eyes it 's so bad
is a town located in the city of huelva you can find this town in the south of spain in the middle between seville and huelva
so honestly i really enjoy having enough time to do as many things as i want to do try to do things which i have never done before
i ca n't choose one person of my whole family however if i have to say just one i could say my cousin because we are the same age and we have been our whole life together
i would like to be an international lawyer because i am deciding which field of law is more accurate for me and i think i will like to solve international problems or international issues
so in the one hand work for paying the university studies provide you to be finally independent and you can manage your own money you can decide for what you are going to spend or you are going to manage your own money in the other hand as a disadvantage you have to work at the same time at you are studying and maybe you are not going to have free time or enough time for you but on my own opinion is really important working while you are studying because you can appreciate the free time and the effort
i 'm going to talk about travelling by airplane so when you have a flight you have to go to the airport and you have many different ways to go there which is car bus or train and then you have to pass the security control to avoid you have provided things with you and maybe you have to wait just five ten minutes and you can stay at the restaurant and then you have to board in the airplane
so technology is an important tool to learn a lot of things
on my opinion the teacher has to teach face to face because a student or the teacher can provide more information more knowledge
i think the most important skill students have to have is to communicate and organize organisation is really important to create an amazing project
in my opinion attending lectures can be perjudicial for the students
i think it 's really important to provide learning facilities because the student can be more concentrated on the matter because he has the facilities
i really appreciate the environment where we live so i personally feel that all of us should look after our land and i firmly believe that if each of one do its part we will get better
we have a very soft spot for watching series together however i prefer watching films on netflix to watch series together because i really really appreciate my time
i have to admit that by far the people which i am really similar to is my mother because our face is quite similar and also when we are speaking sometimes people are confusing our voices because they are so similar
when i was a child i used to think that i would like to live in london however actually i am used to living in a little town like for example now in brazil or before in poland i really like small towns
so let 's begin by speaking about the advantages of this idea i firmly believe that taking a short time per day to have some exercise would be a really good benefit for students to being active and as well there are also some disadvantages like for example schools will miss time for doing their lessons like for example science and another parts would be that 's maybe some students do n't want to do exercise so they will lost time at the school but although all this advantages and disadvantages i firmly believe that this idea it 's really good and it should be recognized by schools and schools should take part to go ahead
so well today i will talk about how bees produce honey so let 's begin by talk that bees collect nectar from flowers outside so they collect the nectar and they bring the nectar to their home where they make honey from nectar in beehives after all of that there is a human part where beekeepers collect honey from beehives and the same person puts the honey in different bottles and that 's all i have to say in this production part
how many is the rent cost how many would cost the alimentation there and all this stuff
studying in a second language could help you to improve your abilities to speak another language and this will also be too much useful when you wanted to get a new job for example because the more you know the more you understand the world
this is a very difficult question because depend of the students
firstly if the students want to know something about local culture they should go into traditional parties for example or ask to local people there
i have to confess that i totally agree with that statement because i believe that all people need one moment in their life to feel comfortable with their self and to develop their independence
i live in a three bedroom house it is located at slap bang in the city centre and it is very nice and cosy house and i love to stay at home rather than going out in current scenario of virus
so holiday is a part of life which i never want to miss and when i am in holiday i love to do tracking and capture scenic views of landscapes which is one of my favourite hobby as well
okay so this is a tricky question he is just one year old and all the day i love to enjoy his naughtiness and playing with him with different kind of games
talking about the job i would love to do a teaching job
according to my opinion nowadays students should do the part time job in order to pay for their university studies which may help to broaden their horizon in terms of new skill which helps them boost their personality besides this they can learn tremendous skills in terms of teamwork which is helpful to boost their personality and that might be helpful in studies as well talking about the cons of this in my knowledge there is just one disadvantages of the job which is devoting less time towards the study so i agree that doing part time jobs are very better than doing just only studies
in this day and age we have lots of resources to use like technology internet which can be used to study and learn for according to me one can learn from internet because there are plenty of things on the internet to learn and study
i fully agree with this statement that face to face learning is the best option because we can get feedback at the time and even by learning face to face we can get all the answers of our queries or questions from the tutor
it helps to build a lot of skills including team skills communication skills
in my opinion attending lectures are more effective than reading alone one may get bored by reading alone and may fall asleep but attending lecture make its curiosity more and more to learn more
it is extremely important for the university to get updated with the learning facilities like superfast internet and p cs laptops and all these technological devices which are needed for students to help learn and study more
i like to do sports or exercise ride to bicycle and read books or comics
i can speak english with my boyfriend or with friends
i like to be invisible
the all university students all do part time job is the advantage is i win a lot of money
the acid is carry by pollution and up in the air the acid partic are in smoke and the acid particles are carried by wind and the acid partic are in rain and snow and damage the environment because is very dangerous
i drinking water is very important because my body needs a water i could not live without water
in my opinion it is necessary to do sport every days because the body is healthy
i think that you have for sleep seven or eight hour in order to have a rested body and a full battery
the technology is very good because i help for running
i live in a big flat which is near to the centre of the town it has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and the dining room is very big
i really like spending time with my friends going for a walk or listen to music sometimes watching a film or reading an interesting book you know
my only brother he 's very special and we really like going for a walk you know around the forest or talking about any kind of issue or topic
i would love to be a teacher because i really like teaching kids and i 'm also like to have you know really long holidays in summer
so i think that one of the advantages is that if you do n't have a lot of time to study you concentrate better and your time is more effective you know and on the other hand you will be exhausted with no time for your friends so i think you have to be very careful if you get a job while you 're studying so in my opinion if you can do n't work at the same time but sometimes life challenge us so why i can tell you go for it and study and work like is the best thing you do
if you want to travelling by plane there are a few steps that you need to know first of all you have to go to the airport in some transport like by car or by bus or train then you arrived to the airport and it 's time to do the check in pass through document control and then the security wards will see if everything is okay then you have to wait in the waiting room you can eat something or go to the bathroom or restroom or drink a coffee and finally they will call you on board and it 's time to take off the plane
so they can search information in the internet to improve their knowledge
yes i think it 's more special you know because the teacher can ask your doubts in the moment
they will learn how to work together and to do n't have always their opinion the right opinion and share responsibilities also i think it 's very good
yes i think when someone lectures you you will capt more information than by yourself and then later you can read alone everything to understand it
i think it 's on the top now of everything
very interested unfortunately i do n't have money to travel but i am very interested in learning about other countries cultures and languages
i like reading i like listening to music i like watching t v and netflix i like cooking too i like making desserts for my family
for me is listening to music and watching cartoons i watch a lot of cartoons and i listen to lots of music in english and for me that 's the best way for me obviously for other people there 's a different way to that
i think i would like to learn other languages like really just other languages i am fascinated by that
talking about university students and part time jobs they should be doing that i mean one of the advantages are they would know the outside world as it is itself disadvantage would be that they would n't have time to focus on their studies that 's what they should be doing but in my own opinion most of the students there are not able to pay for college they are already doing part time jobs so if everyone did it would be just you know fair to everyone everyone would know the world as it is itself and everyone would have disadvantages of not having a hundred percent of your time to focus on studying
acid rain is really easy to understand hear me out factories and vehicles they produce smoke some of these acid particles can fall as dust and they cause damage to the environment other acid particles the more light ones they are mixed with cloud water so when this water in the clouds they precipitate as rain or snow is not just water or snow that is raining is water and snow or snow plus acid so it causes a lots of damage to the environment is really easy
first of all look for a nutritionists if they are good they are going to give you a really good system that you can work with and there will be close to what you 're used to and you will create the habit of reading good things
not everyday but at least two to three times a week exercise that good for your health that good for your body so you have to keep your body functioning good and exercise are going to help with that so do it at least two to three times a week
i totally agree it is on our sleep then our body recovers our energy that our metabolisms work better so is on our sleep that our body functions you know recycling themselves so sleep eight hours people
i think technology is a tool and as a tool can be used as a positive and a negative effect so in this case it might had a negative effect but it 's not technology fault it 's people 's
i am really interesting on environment because we have the responsibility of the world
i really like going to the cinema with them because we laugh very much and then we can speak about the film we have just see i like it so much
well i think my husband is similar to me because we understand each other and we laughed very much together and we think many things similar
i would like to live in london for example because i would like to learn english the english language i think in spain is so difficult to speak it
i think the advantages are for example that it is necessary to the health to our health but the disadvantages are for example that we can do fitness out of the classes of schools and college i think the students can do every fitness classes in the gym out of the school in my opinion i think is so important the fitness the exercise the sports and it could be possible that you try fitness classes
well i am explaining how honey is produced first bees collect the nectar from the flowers and go to their beehives and the bees make the honey from the nectar and then beekeepers collect the honey from these beehives and then they directly go to the shop and in the shop the customer buy them
well i think students choosing a country like a london because they look at the party and the university it was ok
they find difficults in the language in the culture
they can learn about the children
i think it 's absolutely true because they need to have lunch alone to cooking to pay payment and
the place in which i live is very beautiful and it 's very very tranquility
when i have holiday i am enjoy to listen to music pass time with my family and do exercise with my friends and read books
my family and i like to eat in our favourite restaurant because we enjoy eating a lot of food
i would like to have my own company in the future and help my family economically because it is very important to me do this
to get jobs to pay your university studies have some advantages like you can have independent economy and you can have more laboral experience
as you can see in the diagram if you can travel to another country first of all you have to travel to the airport finally you must wait for the airplane and finally you can board the airplane
students should use the technology to practice their activities in the university to understand in a better way the concepts and information that your professors give them
it 's important the face to face learning because you can ask some questions to the professor if you have doubts
group projects it 's an interesting thing in which you can learn more about your topics because you experiment with the activities
attending lectures it 's important to use because you can hear specialised professors so you can learn more about the topics
i 'm from yokohama so i tell you about yokohama yokohama has many sightseeing place so for example chinatown or museum chinatown is a good place
i always enjoy playing american football and talking with my friends so i belong to american football club so i like american football and playing american football
i spend free time with my little brother he is ten years old so i like him and i read book to my brother
i want to be a pilot so i want to work in aviation company i like airplanes and commercial planes so i want to work there
i think all students should not get jobs to pay all their university studies i have two reasons first we should study on focus in universities that is why i think all students should not get jobs to pay all their university studies
okay i will tell you about travelling by airplane first you arrive at airplane by transportation like a car or a bus or train and then you have to check in and you go to document control to check your bags and luggage third step you should wait at hall and you can go bathroom and eat lunch finally you can board on the airplanes
we can use technology instead of our brain because i think we use brain to use only consider
i think face to face is important things because we can communicate with people on face to face we express our feelings
i think attending lecture is better than studying alone
i think it is necessary to provide learning modern facilities because we must catch up with era so we can get knowledge
well i am really interested in learning about other countries because for my career i need to learn of other culture how they deal with the bargains and all these things so i prefer to take advantage from know about this cultures and make my deals
i 'm keen on doing exercise it 's really important for me for example i 'm going to the gym and make some exercise with the dumbbells and well i feel stronger and feel good with myself so for me it 's incredible
i get a buzz from listening music it 's incredible because you can put your headphones and improve your skills in english because you can listen some words that you never listen in your life so that is the best way to learn and maybe reading
well i would prefer learning gymnastic rather than learn about i do n't know other topics because it 's very important for me that movements feel great with me and with my body i want to reach my limits
many students at this moment do part time jobs however this have many advantages you can develop new skills and the things that professional environment wants to other people improve your know how about the things that you learn in the school on the other hand the disadvantages of this is that there are many students do n't have time or maybe are not very organised to do these things and is difficult for many people yes but however in my opinion you need to do this and take the risk to make the both things because in the future many companies will be impressed about your story that how do you know all this things and well you can say ah well i was a student and employee so i can do the both
so in this presentation i am going to show how the acid rain is form through the pollution and in this particles mix with the cloud water and maybe in the future this could be a very very hard for many people in their skin and they could suffer some dramatically situations because the environment is not the best for us at this moment so we need to save the environment and clean the things
well i recommend people take a one point five liters of water every single day to be hydrate and feel comfortable with themselves that is important because the water is life and the life is very important for everyone you know
yeah for me is very essential
well as we said technology is very important right now people need this new devices to improve in their health and i think it 's the best way to improve the lives of people with the technology you know
i think it 's interesting because you know about different things also you know about how people think or how people do things so i think it is very important and also it is very interesting
i like to do different activities in my free time
i like to do different things to improve my english i like to watch movies a lot because it help me to improve my speaking and my listening also i like to read my favourite books
i want to learn swimming because i think it 's very important also it is very good for our health our body to keep fit also it is important i think
first of all i think the advantages of part time for student how studying is it will help them to focus on another thing not just at studying and it will help them to reduce their stresses and also get a little money that help them at their study but i think that disadvantages is they maybe focus on their work and forget their studying in my opinion i think it 's very important to it is a very good idea to work part time because help them to be more relax calm and happy
the acid rain started from factories and vehicles they make pollution and they go out and the when they get to the wind and mixed with the clouds and some of it fell as dust and the other iced particle mixed with cloud water acid practice are in rain or snow so it 's come to earth by raining or snowing and acid rain is very damage to our environment
i first want to avoid eating fast food and drink a lot of water also eat a lot of vegetables and fruit because it is very important for health
drink lots of water is very important because it cleans our body from dirt also it is very important for our brain because it make it work well
i think it is very important to do exercise every day because it is very important for our body for our brain and it is reduce our stresses also it help us to be more relax and happy and also keep our body fit
i think it is right
i think it is a negative effects for people have because nowadays we just stay at the computer or any technology and eat and everything come to us so i think we should look at our life and try to change it
i am very interested as we all live in the planet
we like both playing sports and having some drinks we usually play some football matches on weekends and then we usually go to bars and have some beers and talk about life
almost everybody says i take after my mother they say we are both really alike and i think that 's the answer my mother i looked on photos of her as children
i do n't really know yet but maybe another country just to explore new places new cultures new idioms and new food and a new people of course
i think that 's a good idea but more for schools than college disadvantages i do n't really see any disadvantage maybe in college people they are avoiding to study more important things in my opinion this is necessary to in schools get e p class
so this diagram shows how honey is produce at first there are animals that are called bees that collect nectars from flowers many flowers they travel to their beehives where all the bees make honey but not in a way we can consume it so that 's the beekeepers ' aim they bottle it and get in the transport usually van or in other types of transport and just get in shops to get bought
they should consider things as the culture they have the language they speak
studying in a second language it 's difficult but your second language will improve a lot if you study and talk every day in the second language
maybe being by themselves and not living with their families
they know about local culture every day when they communicate they talk with native speakers and they are living in the streets every day visiting to monuments and eating their own food
that 's evident when you are not still living with your family you are living by yourself with maybe some roommates it will help you to cook by yourself clean everything in the house be more independent
the place where i live it 's very nice i like it a lot it has a very good weather we have a beach so in the weekends we can go out to the beach and spend a good time with our friends and also i like that it 's not that big so we do n't have a lot of traffic
it depends where i go to the holiday but if it 's a beach i prefer sometimes to stay in the hotel and enjoy all the experiences the hotel give us but when it 's to a city i prefer knowing more the city
a person in my family that i enjoy spending time with it 's my little brother because i can play a lot with him and he 's very funny and i never get bored and also we have like very different character so we get along a lot
my dream job is to be a professional dancer but i am not studying for that so i think that in the future i will be working as an industrial engineering and i hope to be working in a very sophisticated business
i am going to be talking if students should get jobs to pay for the university studies and i think that it 's not a must but if we can do it it 's ok like it 's great if we can help out our parents with some money because i know that sometimes it can get really stressful for our parents to pay for our studies coz university it 's very expensive everywhere and i also think that we have to just help them out but some of the disadvantages are that sometimes we can get really stressful with that and we can lower our grades in my opinion it 's better if you do n't do it
i am going to be talking about what you need to do to travel by airplane and at first you have to get to the airport you have to go by bus by car by whatever you want then you have to do a check in because that 's a way that you said that you are there on time and they register all your suitcases then you have to go to a document control then pass the security because they do n't allow a lot of items like weapons and knives then you have to pass to an area where you have to wait till you can board to the airplane and finally you board to the airplane and then you are ready to go out to your destination and that 's all
i think that technology has give us a lot of good ways to study and one thing we can use technology is we can we record ourselves and then listen once and again the recording to memorise everything more easily and fast
i agree with them because when we have virtual classes we do n't pay the same attention than when we have a face to face professor coz we do n't feel the pressure of giving our hundred percent in the class
i think that the most important skill that we develop is that we get to improve our communication and also to be very patient with our friends because sometimes we get very stressful that they do n't do anything and yeah
i think reading alone it 's better because we are focused in what we are reading and when we do attending lectures i think that we lose a little bit the focus of what we are reading
a lot because nowadays we have like a lot of technology and a lot of different new things that we can use for us to learn more like for example there are a lot of pages online that have games for us to have more entertaining way to learn
i separate the trash and use products than can be reused and when i 'm not at home i turn off the lights and use just some ecological products
my mum is more similar to me we enjoy the same things do the same things and we have the same likes of things
i could be delight if i live at the beach i would enjoy a lot to the sound of the sea
nowadays mexico it 's at number one at obesity that it 's very very bad for youth so the schools and the universities need to include sports classes to help to the population to be a healthier lifestyle and do campaigns to decrease the range of obesity
good morning and thanks for coming today i will talk about how honey is produced first you know that the bees collect the nectars from flowers next the bees make honey from nectar in beehives the beekeepers collect the honey from beehives
the most important aspect to consider when you want to choose the city or the country where you going to study it 's that this country has a lot of security for you
actually all the boss need to have more qualificated employees
i think that the most difficult situation is that you are far from home you do n't know a lot of people in the new country but you need to do a lot of new friends to do n't be alone
the easier way to know about other culture at your new country is talk with people talk with people and make new friends that teach you the culture of the country
we enjoy doing together for example watching a t v program playing football or cook in my kitchen even if we prepare different subjects for the exams
the most similar member in my family is my father because physically we are really the same the same weight the same face
in the future i like that i will be in singapore because i in love with their technological advances and their politicians
as far as i 'm concerned the crux of the matter is that one of disadvantage are for example that you during your class you will keep fit and you are a healthy body one of disadvantage that i think is that if you go to school to study and you in the school to do fitness classes you in your house need spend more time to prepare your lesson in your exams
in the first moment bees take the nectar into flowers next bees with this nectar make honey in beehives when the bees make honey beekeepers use the bees ' honey from beehives to fulfil different bottles and with this bottles inside a car or a truck the bottles are transport to different and diverse supermarkets for example local shops big commercial centres or even your house and when you have the bottle in your supermarket with one or two pounds you can buy this
i guess that the advantage are that when you are study a issue and you learn about this you only learn one things but if you study in a second language you can learn the both things at the same time really
is difficult because you need get on other people you need to make more independence things such as wash your kitchen or sweep the floor and is very hard when you live alone
i believe that you do n't really know the local culture when you go abroad during the months during the weeks you can see other people you can hear different things and then you learn about this local culture
obviously when you live alone or you live with your classmates or colleague you will have more responsibilities because when you live in your country and you are a student normally you live with your partners
cadiz is a very sunny city it has two main beaches and the weather is really comfortable it 's always sunny and a little bit windy
when i 'm on holiday i mostly travel to different countries i 'm very interested in the culture of the central and northern europe so whenever i have the opportunity i travel there so i can see the cities their aesthetics their architecture i visit museums and so on
and even our characters are very much alike we do n't resemble each other
but in the model of the english speaking countries i really think that yes i agree with a position of getting a job to pay for the university studies just because you do n't have to depend on banks and you do n't have a loan for years you can grow as a person you can learn how to manage your time and then you are able to enter the adult life the main disadvantages i see are that although it has many benefits you also will have less time to study less time to spend with your friends less time for yourself ultimately
well travelling by airplane is one of the most common ways to travel nowadays and the stages you need to follow to travel by plane are the next first you have to travel to the airport by car by bus by train and then you have to check in with your company then pass a document control with the police and a security control they check your bags after that you have to wait for the boarding hour to your plane then board and then the plane flies to your destination
i really agree with that affirmation because teachers have the knowledge and have the knowledge to pass on their own knowledge so that 's a very important skill
i think group projects are great to learn the basic skill of teamwork which you will need along your professional life most definitely although it can also lead to distractions and to confrontation but i think that 's a very positive skill to get
yes definitely i think that attending to lectures is one of the best ways to grasp the concept that you can potentially not understand when studying by yourself on your own and yes i agree
learning facilities are the pinnacle stone of learning
i 'm so interested and i try to help it because is our home
we much enjoy doing together go to parties get out to go and how can i say that eat or dancing or singing i love to go to the pool
the most similar for me is my brother i have a twin he is younger than me but only for three minutes
so you must need to be prepare for this fitness classes
next bees makes honey from nectar in beehives apart of that the next step is beekeepers collect honey from beehives they must need to be protect
studying in a second language it 's hard at the beginning but when the time pass you are going to improve your language and you are going to speak normal
local culture is too important because when you go to other country you must need to get into of this type of culture
i 'm interested in learning other countries and i wanted to learn computer science in united states
my spending free time is reading books and watch movies and talking friends and going restaurant
i do n't have a idea of which one is best one because i 'm just finding now but so far online learning is best i think
i wanted more communicative talkative skills and i want to talk with more people
the advantages are good salary and yeah the students understand what 's going on when they will work in the future but disadvantages are they do n't have the time to study so in my opinion they should n't do part time jobs all students should n't do part time jobs while they are studying because yeah some students want to study more studies so yeah
and secondly acid particles are carried by wind and the others areas and next some acid particles fall as dust to the land or the others acid particles mix with cloud water and finally rain falls and acid particles are in rain and getting acid rain and damage the environment
please eat more vegetables and fruits and do n't eat much of meat or some kinds of ingredients
drinking water is important because people have eighty percent of human body is water so please drink water
every day doing exercise is not essential but yeah if you can you do it i think and yeah once week exercise is very important
depends on people i think there 's a people who needs seven hours or eight hours but i think people should know how long they need
well i enjoy spending my free time most in two ways one is listen to music and the other is reading books his book is very awesome
well in my opinion the best way for me to improve my english is to form a habits of getting exposed to the environments of english so when i was in a class i will always involved myself in the classroom and in the classroom 's teachers
well i want to learn to how to play the piano because i love its delicate yet powerful sound it makes and i want to play the sweet song for those who need music bringing happiness and enthusiasm to those who need it that 's all
well as the old saying goes every coin has two sides doing part time job both have advantages and disadvantages on one hand doing part time job can build our confidence and then will provide the chance to improve our skills and prepare for the future jobs but on the other hand if one spend most of the time in doing part time jobs the time spent could be reduced in studying so my opinion is that everyone who want to do part time jobs should better have a wise consideration before that decision that 's all
ladies and gentlemen it 's my honour to be here to give a presentation about the acid rain it start from the factories and vehicles they give off pollution into the air and the acid particles are in the smoke so this how it damage to our environment ladies and gentlemen we only have one earth and that 's the reason why we should take care of it thank you for listening
is of great importance and then prepare the lunch and dinner well because it 'll give you energy
well i think drinking a lot of water is of great importance and only water can protect us from being thirsty
so this is the foundation of the happy life we have
well i think this questions depends on different individuals because some of the people who need to sleep eight hours or more
i like travel so much
i usually watching t v once a day run for my village
the best way for improve my english is talking with english person because they could help you in your english
the advantages that the student should do part time job while they are studying is they could earn money so they will buy anything with your money and disvantage they lose time that they can study for prepare your submits
the centre of the city produce pollution and the factory produce pollution this pollution is convert in acid particles are in smoke these acid particle fly by wind and other particle acid particle are in rain or snow
in my opinion the people must n't junk food because they food damage your healthy
drink water is really important you have to drink water five times a day is really important for your body
yes at least doings exercise once a day you only need thirty minutes it 's enough
i think that it 's ok because you should sleep more than eight hour or less than six hour
i think that it 's possible because you can talk with other person in any moment you can use whatsapp
i live in a small flat with my boyfriend and my two cats my flat it 's very small but it is very cute and i have a big balcony and the windows are very big too
in my family i enjoy spending time go for a walk in a forest or going in a camping site sleep in a tent and do a fire
well in the future i will want a job in a human resources department in a factory for example and will do the payrolls and the
well i think that if you pay the university studies it 's because you try to find a job a good job but no this no is true some people study in the university and do n't find the job for his studies in my opinion a lot of people study for example human resources my degree but no people is in job with an employ law or in human resources department
to travel by plane then in the first time you need to travel to airport in car by bus in car or by train it 's not important in the airport the first thing is check in and you 're checking your suitcase for example and the police check your document control and your suitcase if you you want you can take a coffee or go to a bedroom and then you board the plane and finally the plane take off
i think that the students can use technology is very important because in the classroom they can write the exercise in laptop for example
well i think that it 's better that the people learn face to face to the teacher but now with the coronavirus and the quarantine the skype or the zoom is necessary for the people learn
well i think it 's very important to do a project in a group because the people learn to listen and communicate
no i think that the people learn most better alone reading alone because you 're in your room in your desk is the best form for learn
i think that it is necessary that university try to do a lot of learning facilities that it 's possible because it 's very important to learn the students
i enjoy meeting friends meeting my family i enjoy studying english searching on the internet on just walking in the park
i most enjoy spending time with my daughter she is beautiful young woman with creative thinking and she can give me many good advice
i want to get a job in recently future in a non government organisation
advantages for student who they have a job while he 's studying at university is have experience and skills for his future speciality disadvantages is a lack of time for studying and preparing for tomorrow 's classes
at first you should travel to airport to arrive at in on time then you need to go to check in your luggage after the police check your documents and security check in your luggage all your suitcases you should wait while this process finish after that you will be invited to the gate and finally you will board on the plane
technology makes the study of students more easier internet engine and e book are partially replacing traditional book
i think this studying face to face with your teacher is the best way to study well because the teacher during a process of studying can fix your mistake
at first is a skill get along with team members and have good communicate this means students must have good communicate skills
attending lection includes communication between teacher and students
providing modern learning facilities is very important because it 's makes easier for students studying process
do you know about practice make perfects everyone say that and it really works and there is the fact and if you really really want to improve your english practice every day
i would be trying anything about creativity and arts because there is something interesting with that
i think the question is about should do the part time jobs while they are studying and the disadvantage for me is maybe the focus is divided coz you should do the part time job at the same time where you are studying in the university and my opinion about that is it 's about your preference if you can maintain your time management very well i think do part time job is a good things for you
so some acid particle fall as the dust and other acid particle mix with cloud water
i do n't think i have a good advice for this question but my simple advice is reflection why you eating a good food what 's your motivate to do this it 's come for yourselves
yeah i think so do exercise is essential item because it 's makes your body stretch and make your body health for the future so you must to do exercise as much as you can even you busy on doing your work so do it ten minute a day
i think it 's depend on their age or their activity coz human is complicated system so one and other is different so the important things that you have to remember is sleep enough so yeah
of course in my opinion technology makes everything so instantly effective and efficiency it 's positive but the part of you must remember is balance it coz everything that too much it 's not good for you
i got interested when i was child i always like to learn about other countries and other languages
i spend my free time reading books watch series watch movies and dancing
the best way i improve my english is reading and listening videos podcast and music and speak in the mirror
disadvents are less time to study and my opinion is important all university students should do part time jobs while they are study because it 's important the students work and study at same time
well acid rain happens because of pollution as you can see factories and cars end up pollution the air with carbon dioxy this particles in the smoking are blown way by the wind and some acid particles fall like a dust those blown away by the wind mix with clouds of water then cause the acid rain or falling with snow
drinking water is important because our body needs keep up hydratating and our kidneys needs keep working
yes doing exercise every day is very important for our body and our health
a good sleep night means a good day of work
lately technology is a great enemy for health because has become the people sedentary
i love their history
i love play football i like play video games and i go to the gym every day
the advantage i think the people then work and studying is can be they have money and opportunities to be experienced
the pollution begin when the factories work and the wind go out the engine then the pollution go up for the sky and the wind translate this wind with the sky with the cloud other acid particles mix with cloud water and finally the acid particle are in rain snow doing damage to environment
ok if youwant to be good eating habits you must eat fruits and vegetables and do n't eat hamburgers
it 's very important because the human really needs drink water every day if you do n't drink water you can be sick
i think eight hours or seven hours that 's a good time to sleep
i think it 's very positive because you can find new jobs using the technology and you can create your applications or different things for contribute with the technology humanity
interested is because i needed to improve my english
i spend my time with study english and watching t v series without subtitles
in this moment is speak with you
the disadvantages are that students will divide their time between work and study if they do not have a discipline it 's a problem is essential to future career
and this acid particle are carried by wind some acid particle fall and dust to river for example and the other acid particles mix with cloud water and in rain in transforming in your rain and snow in synthesis is very bad pollution it damage to environment
i think the technology is to different activity your day and i think is very good if use it with discipline and good sense
it 's a really really beautiful city in spain i feel like home i find a lot of people who are very very kind so this is a wonderful wonderful city in this country
during my holidays usually i like to watch a lot of movies for example in christmas holidays i really like to watch christmas films classics and news so it 's like a hobby during holidays for me
oh that is an interesting question because i have two members in my family that i really like to spend my time with them but my sister my answer is my sister is like a second mother to me that i really love she and she is very kind to me i like it
oh but that 's so so interesting because right now i am study business administration it 's my dream
well in this subject is a little bit complicated to give an opinion but at first if the students works to pay their universities is interesting it 's very very interesting because they can say i can work in whatever they want and they can pay what they really want they do it for her future the disadvantages is also maybe the job it can be a source of stress for the student and if they can work some month or some week for the university they does n't have the incomes that they need to pay her university in my point of view yeah it 's good but it depends about the degree and the economic situation for every students is i do n't know
well travelling by airplane it 's nice but we must pass for a lot of steps at first we must go to the airport by car train or bus in the vehicle what we want when we are in the airport we must go to the desk and do our check in or we can do it online then we must pass by document control maybe if we need a visa or not it 's not always like that then we pass the security controls with our carry on bags then we have the wait it 's a little bit tired but we must do it then we have to board on the airplane and at the ends we have the departure of our flight it 's wonderful
well nowadays we use a lot of technology to study for example now we have the opportunity to use different kind of technology like ipads or tablets and also our laptops help us to study better and easier and faster
well in my own point of view and in my own experience it 's better it 's better to me because i have a good memory when others talk to me and explain me face by face but someone says it is not always like that it depends
oh in group projects it 's really complicated sometimes and we develop our patient maybe patient and empathy is the most important aptitude that we develop with these kind of projects
to be honest for me it 's useful attending lectures it 's better to me but i know that a lot of people thinks that it is n't be useful it is awful for them but i think it help us maybe you can remember something in this kind of activities
i think it 's very very important that universities or schools or any kind of place give us more facilities to learning because we are in a new era and we must have more access and modern to the information
i live in a wonderful place we 're near a swimming pool and a basketball ground i can play basketball with my friends on weekend or after school and i also can swim with my friends
i enjoy playing basketball with my friends we play basketball around six person and we divided into two teams we often win this game and that 's a good experience for me and good relax for weekends
first it can give them money to support them to study for their college fee and its can give them an experience that can have a lot of benefits when they 're come into real work and if they can not balance their work life balance it will have a lot of disadvantage maybe their grades will be affected
if you want to travel by plane you first should travel to the airport you can travel by car bus or train when you come to the airport you need to first check in and document control will control your document and you will go to the security make sure you do n't brings knives and others things that can harm people and after a long time wait you can have some coffee buy some gifts and go to toilet or eat something then you can go abroad that 's all
i think we can use technology to search for some difficult questions that teachers may not answer and we can also use technology to watch some videos about some important question
yes i think learning from us teacher face to face is the best way because students can learn from teachers ' movements and get a better understanding and teacher can get students ' feedback very quickly and give them answer
i think there are many skills such as leader 's skills they can lead a team and make everybody do things they like to do and they also can have the skill to cooperating with friends
i think attending a lecture is very important because the lecturer the speaker of the lecture are also the specialist of the area and they can give you a clear understanding of this area but books you read you ca n't get the point of the writer
i think that 's very important because students can know how to learn from this learning facilities and teachers can get feedback very clearly from students from this learning facilities
normally i used to go to the gym or church as well and spend some time with my family watching some movies walking around the beach for instance yeah
practicing
maybe playing piano
well it depends so it 's a advantage if you consider that they will be more responsible with their own things obviously they have some disadvantages because they will have not so much time maybe to have fun maybe sometimes to evaluate the right situations in school or maybe in the work because sometimes it 's not possible deliver in the best way in both sides
so from my understanding this image is dealing with acid rain because they have a lot of consequences in our environment because they can damage a lot the environment so we have some particles that fall as dust and can as well rain or snow and damage the environment so this is the pollution so this is my understanding about this image
it 's very important because water is the best drink that you can use for a daily basis so it 's very important drink always water in the morning afternoon evening because it will clean our body
yes personally normally i go to gym four times in a week and it 's very important because it 's part of healthy living
yes i totally agree because sleeping it will have some consequences in our daily basis
now i am living in apartment in the south of bogota with my wife and sometimes other persons or people from my family comes to visit me
i really enjoys watching movies and eats popcorn and doing exercise and visit my family is all
i really enjoy spending time with my wife is the very very very very important person in my life the most important person in my life because we share all time
i think that in the future i had two differents kinds of things i want to travel
and but disadvantage is that the time is very very very short is all
ok there are six steps to take a travel by airplane it 's very easy the first is travel to airport the second step is to do check in pass through document control and security after people need wait to board after they are need board it is very important when the people travelling by airplane it 's better do n't bring a own car maybe travel to airport in a bus
i agreed the technology is a great tool and the study is more easy
that depends for people it 's easier to learn when the teacher is near
i am very interested in learning other countries especially the cultural things
i would like to watch some videos movies t v series things like that
i would like to have some conversations with artificial intelligence to practise my speaking english and listening skills
i really wanted to learn the skills of coding especially with artificial intelligence i want to build applications with this technology
well i think one of the advantages must be that they can earn money through those part time jobs but at the same time those jobs may distract them from their studies so they may have poor academic performance my opinion is i think those students who have good self control skills can try the part time jobs because for them they can manage their own time there 're more advantages than disadvantages to those students yeah
and they can drain acid particles that are in smoke and then the acid particles are carried by wind some of them may fall as dust which can be damage to environment
eat more fruits vegetables and plants and beans definitely not fat foods
water is really important to our human body and you know make sure that you eat enough water every day so that you can get away from you know illness anyway
well in my opinion i think it depends on different people like maybe it 's over you know it 's not a good frequency for people to do every day
in my opinion i think it depends some people may need eight hours some people may need less or some people may need more i think it just depends on different situation in different people
well i think is not a black and white question i think it depends on the people who use the technology like you can use it to help you find great exercise video
i like the summer because i have a hobby like parachuting skydiving and during the summer is better to practice my hobby and it 's also good to eat to sleep so i prefer the summer during the year
i was a very happy child i had time to play by myself and even with my younger sister i have a sister eight years younger than me and she was like my doll i worked a lot and played a lot with her it was a really good time for me
i hope to have a good retirement i would like to have money enough to have a good healthcare and travel a lot not only inside my country but also out of the country and eat well and see a lot of different things
yes i think that university courses should include a period of back to work experience it 's important to guarantee that students will go to the working time knowing what is waiting for them students can be prepared to be more efficient some disadvantages of this one is that we need to have investments in laboratories and other stuffs to guarantee that works experience it will be valid it will be enough to support the learning of these students in the real conditions but the quantity of advantages of course is very bigger compared with the disadvantage of this kind of stuffs
hello i will do a presentation about people visiting three new onlines pop site music sites on the graph below we can see in the blue line the website music now in orange line the site songs four you and in reds line the site tunes net we can see along seven days one week as we can see on the x bar and we can see a big improvement on the tunes net on the last days of our checking and we can see a reduction in the other two sites music now and songs four you maybe due to the changes of the material showed presented on these websites
i think that disagree is a strong word i think that the team members should be encouraged to share his point of view no matter if it 's aligned or not aligned with the remain members of the team
i do n't think so
i think that it 's a sensible point of view if you are looking for a short time maybe sometimes a guy that 's working alone will have better results
it 's very interesting to learn a new language in different country of france and it 's an great experience for me
i enjoy my free time when i practice basketball sports and i play video games with my friends and my family
the best for improve my english will be if i go to country anglophone oh i can speak english all day
i want learn english language because it 's a language which offer the opportunity in the world and it 's a language the most speak in the world
i think it 's a really really good things when we are student the first problem is have n't got experiences when to start of job i do n't think i have disadvantage and this case will be a great experience for all students
this image watch how the pollution affect the environment some particle acid of pollution which affect all the environment as the pollution can be seen in the vehicles and affect all the environment
the most important for the human is drink water
sleeping is things important for enjoy life all day
the technology can be positive and negative
i really keen on new cultures i 'm from europe so i am familiar with cultures or european cultures that 's the reason why i would love to learn about foreign cultures such as indian culture
during my free time i love visiting museums i think that learning about art and our history can explain our current situation and thanks to living in madrid i can go to several famous museums
nowadays the best way for students to improve their english will be to use artificial intelligence platforms such as this one can help students to improve the way that they speak write or his or her reading skills
if i had the possibility to learn a new skill definitely it will be to learn a new language maybe a language that it seems difficult such as chinese or japanese this kind of language will help us in the future
university students that do part time jobs are better in organising their schedules or their studying time but on the other hand it is difficult to them to focus on their exam so it would be kind of stressful during exam periods to work and study at the same time but i will say that the optimal situation would be maybe to work in a part time job that is related with our or your area of studying such as for example if you are studying law it will be interesting to work with a lawyer that can helps you to understand better your knowledged about law
climate change is one of the biggest challenge that human being are facing nowadays mainly it is caused because of pollution pollution that factories emit or produce when they are working or functioning this pollution contains some acid particles that are both in the wind or in the clouds it is important to be aware that this kind of acid particles arrive into our lakes or rivers damaging its species that live there such as octopus or maybe different kind of fishes but on the other hand due to the acid rains which is in the clouds it can reach into forests damaging our trees
my best piece of advice in terms of eating a healthy diet will be to introduce in this diet different types of food such as vegetables cereals fresh meat
drinking water is an habit that really helps your body to maintain the energy that it needs to face the complete routine as a day and it helps your organism to work better
i will said that it depends on the person and lifestyle of that person if you love doing exercise why not doing every day
the healthiest option is to exactly sleep eight hours per day but there are some studies that shows that sleeping just six or seven hours per day helps as well
positive effect of course i think that thanks to technology we are allowed to do several activities such as for example work from home or taking some pictures about our daily life and also it has improved healthcare system
i live in a city that is one of the most big in my country
definitely i enjoy my holidays travelling to where is my all family i mean my cousins my grandfather my grandmother and get a good time with they
i would like to have a job related to engineering or related to simulation for example but i also think that i could have a job with my family for example
all students should get job to pay for their university studies i think the principal advantage of this is related to the students can get some laboral experience but i think that principal disadvantage is related to the time because they 'll lost time that they could use to improve in their studies my opinion is that there are more disadvantage than advantage for get a job being a university student
now i 'm going to tell you about travelling by airplane if you want travelling by airplane you need to travel to the airport then you need to get enter to the facility and after this you have to check in because if you do n't you can fly anywhere after that you will need to pass to the document control security after wait for a hours or maybe a minutes you will be able to aboard the plane this is all after all of this you can travelling by airplane
the students can use the technology searching advances information for example topics related to university career and this is the way that they can use it
i think if you can get a classes face to face you should get that because classes online also it 's good but i think face to face is better
i think the principal skills that we can develop working together in group projects is the effective communication because in this case we will need to solve several problems
attending lectures it could be better for some people because they can get help from their classmate but in my opinion i prefer get reading alone
i think that if we are in university we need to focus in learning facilities abilities because these are the topics that will be important in the future
i am very interesting about learn new things
i like spend my free time going to gym
the best way to improve my english is watch movies and series and talk when i can
all university student should do part time job while they are studying the advantage of that is they gon na be responsible with job and money they learn about their life and the disadvantage of that is they gon na be less time to application all the course in the university
in the today days the vehicle produce a lot of pollution and the factories too so this pollution have acid particles that in the smoke and some of these acid particles carried by the wind and they mix with cloud and fall like water and it make acid rain some acid particles fall as dust and pollution the rivers and the sea so the solution for that is the electrical vehicles so that 's it thank you all very much
drink water is a must coz your body compose seventy five percent water so is very important drink water all day every day
doing exercise is very important to your health conform you going older it 's very important for your life for everything
i think all people have sleep at least eight hours every night so they gon na be prepared to day
i think technology has a negative point on people life coz when you spend much time on your computer you do n't do exercise it 's the true
i want to learn about cultures and languages and food that 's all
in my free time i like to study to watch movies and to cook
it is speaking about things that you like it
i would like to learn other new languages
the advantages the students we will be more prepared for the work marketing they will be better professionals the disadvantages they will have time less to study but i think it 's important experience that all students to live
the water cycle is influenced for the pollution of factories and vehicles this is very dangerous
i eat fruit and vegetables every day usually i eat fruit and vegetables for morning afternoon and night
the water is very important for health i drinking water one every three hours per day
as water the exercise is very important for health i practise exercise every day
the technology is po positive when it 's used of correct form
i am very interested that 's why i chose to study environmental engineering on university and i want to be part of the transformation and make the world a better place for everyone
we like to cook especially desserts to play games board and card games for example we like to play volleyball too or just stay there together talking about life and plans
definitely my twin sister we look like each other we have the same style we like to talk about the same things and we laugh about the same jokes so definitely my twin sister
i do n't know exactly but i want to have the opportunity to live on the beach for some time just have the experience to live near the ocean go there feel the vibe and have the experience enjoy there
schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes as disadvantages we can say about the weather and the need to adapt some fitness classes so all the students can take this class and enjoy the sun and i agree it should be one priority of the schools and colleges
so today i will talk about how honey is produced first of all bees collect nectar from flowers then they go to the beehives where the bees make honey from this nectar that was collected then beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put them into pots that are ready to be sell then these pots goes to the transportation that takes it to the supermarket when people can buy it
they should consider how safe the country is if the country gives resources to students from abroad and how immersed in their culture the student will be and how much he will learn
the advantages of studying in a second language is that you can get immersed in the culture and lifestyle you can learn new things develop new skills and be able to communicate with more people
learn the language and understand the accents and also live far from home can be another difficulty that students can face during this time
i agree because everything depends on them what they eat how they eat when they are going to eat what they are going to do to deal with finances
i am very much interest in learning about other countries especially about their culture and the language and everything
i like to listen to music and i enjoy to play guitar and to learn other musical instruments
for me the best way to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people to travel abroad and even better to live abroad
well i would like to learn to play sitar it 's a indian instrument
all students should have part time jobs while they were studying well with it you have some advantages for example they will not worry about how they will pay for the university which is a good thing but in the other side there are some disadvantages for it because they would not be able to concentrate in they studies they would not have enough time to learning the disciplines so in my opinion they students should n't have to work to pay for the graduation in a college
well we can see in this picture how the acid rain is produced in the right side of the chart you can see the sources of pollution like factories and vehicles that produce pollution these acid particles are in the smoke that go up in the sky and these particles are carried by the wind some of the acid particles fall as dust and other particles mix with the cloud water and then finally these acid particles follow with the rain or the snow so we can see in this diagram how the acid rain is produced and returned through the soil
well the best advice is to choose the right foods
drinking water is very important to our health so ideally you should drink at least two liters of water per day
yes it 's fundamental to do exercise every day specially cardio exercises also strength exercises stretch exercises so it 's very important to exercise in different ways to improve your health
well i agree that most of people need about eight hours per day some people made seven hours some people a little more but in average a lot of people need eight hours of sleep per day
i think nowadays technology has a terrible effect in the health of people specially in the spine people take so much time in the mobiles phone with a bad position of the neck so in general technology is bad for the health
i am very interested in learning about other countries
in my free time i enjoy studying english trying to learn something new and trying to speak i want to improve my english
i think practising a lot is the best way to me to improve my english
if i could learn a new skill it would be speaking english better or speaking other languages like french and german
i think all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying i think there are some advantages for them to earn some money while they are at university and as the disadvantages i can say that while working or while doing part time jobs they can not find perhaps enough time to study their own lessons so they maybe fail in their studies or in their exam in my opinions each student can arrange their own situation
as you know vehicles and factories produce smoke and this smoke pollutes the air in this polluted air there are acid particles and these particles are carried by wind and after some time these acid particles are in form of air or snow fall down to the earth surface so they damage to environment
i do n't agree with that because this may be true for children because children need more than eight or ten hours but for an adult six hours sleep is enough i think
so it 's a positive effect
i think learning in foreign country is a really interesting thing i can expose to foreign culture and see many sights i never seen before
but last weekend i went to the beach to enjoy the sunshine and the sounds of the waves
i think the best way to improve my english is to practice more only practice more can i speak frequently and writing academically
i think maths is really important nowadays
the part time jobs has positive and negative effects for university students while they are studying for positive effects they have more opportunity to take a responsibility for their tuitions and they can make a plan for their money but however the part time job maybe distract their attention on study and maybe have a active impact on their scores but from my perspective i think some part time jobs may be a bad effect for students university students
how is a rain created they are poured into the air by the smoke and then they are carried by the wind some a particles fall as dust and both the two ways will damage the environment like soils trees and other creatures
you need to eat both meat and the vegetables maybe eggs and fruits
it is really important to drink water in a day
i think that eight hours sleeping is benefit for almost everyone but maybe someone only needs fewer hours to refresh their mind and they do n't need eight hours
it is a fairly quiet city where you can go out to party with friends and it is a beautiful city for studies and other things than do sports
during the holidays i really like to do party go out with my friends in different place and why not different countries i also like to do sports as basketball
one person of my family who i enjoy spending time is my sister
in my future i want to be physiotherapist because i am studying for this work and it 's my dream to become a physiotherapist
there are many advantage of working to pay your studies first of all it allows us to be autonomous and not to have to always ask parents for help it also allows us to meet new people however the fact of working takes us a lot of time and we can revise less much which can be an inconvenience during the studies in my opinion it is a good thing to work during your studies because i did it last year but you also have to find time to work on your classes and find time for your family for your girlfriend and for your friends because it 's very important in the life of the university
i go to present the different stage what people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all we must to travel to airport and one time we are in the airport we can check in and show your documents for pass the security in the second we can wait in a restaurant pass to the toilet and take a coffee and for the fin we can board in the plane and go to the destination
i consider technologies as a great advance for the world because it allows us to do a lot of research and makes your lives a lot easier however we have to be careful how much time we spend on technologies
studying with a teacher face to face is really enriching because he can explain to us directly if we do n't understand certain things
i think that working in a group is a good thing because it allows us to develop more skills as friendships and allowed to meet people and friends
it is very important to develop learning facilities because it allow students to be more autonomous and to find working methods in order to have a good results in the different test
i live in shanghai shanghai is a bustling metropolis which is famous for its futuristic skylines vibrant culture and its prosperous economy it is also a city with a long history dating back to more than a thousand years before
on my holidays i usually go to dance clubs dancing boost my muscular strength and flexibility and as well as improving my cooperation and balance also during the dancing process i improve my confidence
i would like to spend most of my time with my mother because we are both avid readers and we love to share our different opinions about a book or a piece of knowledge inside it and she always encourage me to voice my opinion
well i would like to become a diplomat in the future so that i can voice opinions on different issues on behalf of my motherland i know it 's a demanding job and requires effort but i 'll seize any opportunities to improve my ability
there 's no getting away from the fact that more and more students are willing to take a part time job while they studying at universities so this kind of phenomenon do have some advantages students seize opportunities to earn incomes and they got a salary for their works which helps their parents save a lot of money and should be encouraged but yet it has some disadvantages like part time job may distract students from their normal studying process and do some harm to their academic scores so my opinion is that we should balance our work and study in order to develop ourselves while having access to the society
now i 'm going to introduce the steps of travelling by airplane first you should take some transportations to airport you can rather take a bus or drive by car or take a underground after you arrive at the airport next what you should do is to check in that is to say to put a luggage on the plane ahead of time then you went a document control some officials will do some checks in order to ensure security finally after you have passed the check you can enter the waiting room during the waiting time you can choose to go shopping or having a coffee or eat something if you feeling peckish finally you can go on board and have a good time
so first technology can offer us a lot of new information
well learning face to face sometimes boost efficiency and make me more concentrated on learning itself
there are many advantages and second students can learn a spirit of cooperation which is very important in the society
i think attending lectures is sometimes more effective because when you are listening to others ' opinions you are seeing subjectively and efficiently to judge whether what he said is true or false but when you are reading books you may sometimes just distract
my best ways to improve my skill in english is practice in writing and speaking especially with read the book and watch a movie
of course i will happy for it because i can more effective to communicate with other people and my work
in my opinion doing part time job while they are studying have some advantages and disadvantages the advantages is can be give they responsible to theyselves and disadvantages can interfere they time to study i think it is can be tried but with proportion that is not too much
how pollution causes acid rain first pollution from factories and vehicle are distributes become acid particle in smoke and then this acid particle are carried by wind and some acid particle fall as dust and some other acid particles mix with cloud water and become to rain or snow now that rain or snow it is can be damage to environment health because it phenomena bad
do n't eat fatty foods
it does n't need to be heavy but consistent
and i agree to sleeping more than eight hour
but i think technology more good effects to our health because it more help us
i 'm very interested in learning about different countries when i go on vacation i always visit different places i have visit germany japan and finland
when i have free time i usually do sports i like playing badminton very much i love playing badminton especially the doubles when i playing with my friends together we always have a lot of fun
i always try to speak with my friends in english and i also take english courses because teachers can correct my errors and i also have opportunities to speak with native speakers
i want to learn how to play the guitar i like guitar 's sound i think it 's cool to play the guitar while you are singing and it can heat up the atmosphere too so i want to learn this new skill
there are advantages if university students do part time job for example students can gain skills and working experience and they can earn some pocket money if they want to buy things like cell phone they can pay it themselves and through the working experience they can be independent on the other hand they may have no time for their studies and it can take longer for their studies too because they do the part time jobs personally i do n't think all university students should do part time jobs
good afternoon everyone it 's my pleasure to give a presentation on acid rain please look at this diagram first we see pollution is from factory and vehicles then acid particles are in smoke next acid particles are carried by wind there are two possibilities here first some acid particles fall us dust other acid particles mix with cloud water after that acid particles are in rain or snow that 's how acid rain is formed acid rain can damage environment that brings to the end of my presentation thank you for your listening
i would suggest that they should have three regular meal every day and they should eat vegetables and fruit as much as possible so that they can get enough vitamin
it 's important to drink a lot of water if you do n't drink enough it 's easier to get dehydrated if the body does n't have enough water you will feel very tired and you have no energy to do anything
basically it 's essential to do exercise every day we do n't need to do very much even twenty minutes that would be ok the most important thing is we keep moving and we live well
i think it depends on people some people need eight hours some people need only five hours so the most important thing is you sleep enough if you sleep enough then you have energy to do anything
i think technology has a negative impact on people 's health because we always overuse the computer or smartphone it can harm our eyes our sight
i 'm very interested about learning other countries because it can get me an opportunity to study other traditions and cultures and also i can meet another peoples that i can communicate with to improve my foreign language skills
i enjoy spending my free time with my friends in the school stadium we can play all kinds of sports out there such as ping pong racing and basketball which will make us a healthier body and a fun time
i think the best way for me to improve the english is to read aloud and watch some english movies read aloud will lead me to have a good pronunciations
i 'm learning a new skills about playing piano which is popular and enjoyable skills around the world
it is very common that all university students should do part time jobs while they 're studying and there are many advantages for example they can making friends when they are working with each others and they can also learn many practical skills which might be used in the near future and as for the disadvantages i think they will find it hard to strike a balance between their part time jobs and their studies and in my opinion i think all university students should do the part time jobs and they can do this to improve their self abilities about working with each others
hello i am giving a presentation about acid rain firstly there are many cars and factories generate some pollutions like smoke and the acid particles are in the smoke as the smoke carried by the wind the acid particles will divided into two parts some acid particles will fall as dust and damage to the lake and other acid particles will mix with cloud waters and then they will contain in the rain or snows and that would do a great damage to the environment
well i suggest they can eat more vegetables and fruits because they contain more nutrients than the meat and junk food and this will lead to a stronger health and stronger bodies
so i think drinking water can keeping us alive and give us a clear mind and in the daytime
i think it is quite essential to do exercise every day because this can improve our health and give us a stronger bodies to connect with each others you can doing exercise with other peoples who can share the same interest in sport
i think that an eight hour sleep at night can give us a clearly mind in the daytime

because like that they can have more money more cash and they depend less from their parents a disadvantage of work during the university is that they will have less free time to enjoy the life in my opinion it 's good to have a part time job but not all the time
when the vehicles and the factories are working there 's a lot of pollution and emit smoke with contaminant particles that are carried and mixed in the wind and some of them come back to the earth fall down as contamination and the other is mixed with the clouds when the particles are mixed in the cloud it produce rain and this water have a lot of acid particles and provoke a damage in the environment
to have a good habit to eating is good to eat several kind of fruits less meat and more vegetables and less sugar
is very important to drink water you need to drink water and not another drink like soft drinks or alcoholic drinks because he had a lot of sugar
yes is i do every day exercise and i think it is a good habit because you wake up your body and you are more health
the number of hours to sleep depends from every person each person is different
but usually technology is bad because provoke sedentary life
when i am in holiday i like to go out with my family
i used to be with my brother my brother and his family is very enjoyable
speaking about all students should get jobs to pay for their studies one of the advantages could be that they can take experience about working talking about disadvantages i think that if they work maybe they have n't got enough time to study but in my own opinion if they can do both things it is well
i 'm going to explain how to travel by airplane first we must go to airport to go to the airport we can go by bus train or car in the airport the first thing that we have to do is the check in once we check in we must pass document control and security and then we have to stay waiting in the waiting area we have restaurants toilet shops and cafés so we can eat something after that they will call us to board so then we will go to flight
yes i prefer face to face to technology learnings because face to face the relations are better
in my opinion i like work in group projects because we can share different knowledges and we can speak each other
yes i think that attending lectures is more interesting because the speakers gives us their knowledges
to have modern learning facilities is interesting for the university because like this the university will go a good level university
i live in a place that is a big house with a large scale gardens
normally i prefer to do some indoor sports such as pilates the yogas meditation beside of that i will pick up a book from my bookshelf to read such as a comic books and military books
wow i would like to say that is my mother because both of us have quite similar personality we are gorgeous confidence
well there are a lot of jobs i would like to do
to say that they can compete with their friend in the near future
today i 'm going to introduce several steps of travelling by airline first you need travel to airport by the public transportation or your private car after that you need do the document control by the staff they will check all the details and identify following is security check they might check your personal belongings and your pocket and so on done with all those things you might need wait in your correct gate and sit or go to the toilet or shopping finally you might go on board and fly take off
for the university student they might use google scholar to do their literature review besides that they mind use zooms or teams to consult some questions with their professors and also make effective conversation with their classmate
it is apparently for the normal students face to face of course guide them to be discipline and also to be effective but for the student who are genius study alone is a much better way for them
well firstly they will learn how to negotiate and cooperate with other team members in addition they might study how to manage their personality properly because there are many different views in the teams
i have to say it is hundred percent significant for university to do so because right now the artificial intelligence is very modern and popular among the students
i am very interesting because i want to travel to another countries and meet their culture and traditions and i want to speak with them in this idiom because it 's the most popular language in the world
i used to go with my friends and family to concerts museums and maybe go to swim or a coffee shop just to talk and having some fun but most of the time i 'm just in my house
i used to watch movies reading books and listen to music in english and i used to visit pages like this like write and improve and speak and improve to improve my english better
i could choose learn better and faster without any problems and to keep any information in my hand and i could share it with others
the advantages are that the students can learn more about their work but at the same time they can win or gain more money while they are studying and the disadvantages are that they did n't have a lot of time to work and studying and they can not balance their job and study and so they need free time to do a lot of things and in my opinion they need to work and organisate their times to work and study at the same time without any problems and they can learn and improve their job and study time
this is an image to environment as we can see the factories and vehicles create pollution that became in acid particles in the smoke other acid particles mix with cloud in winter and that fall in rain and snow
i think eating habits are important to improve a healthy life i think that the most important is eat fruit and vegetables that make you feel more comfortable with yourself and your body
it 's very important to drink water because you can clean your body and you need to do it every single day
yes i think do exercise is very important because it makes your body stronger you can do any exercise like swim or football or tennis or any exercise you want but it 's very important to do it always
you need to sleep eight hours per day and if you did n't you going to be more weak
yeah i think both are correct technology brings you information that is very important to us to have a healthy life but also you can find fake news that could be danger for us
i really interested in environment in my opinion it 's really important for our future
learn about circuits and play the video games and see some movies on the cine
i mean my father is more similar of me and it 's tall same me and the same skin

all students can do fitness classes can make a exercise
hi everyone in the first time bees collect nectar from from flowers then bees make honey from nectar in beehives and then beekeepers collect honey from beehives and finally the honey it 's in a supermarket for all consumers
i mean the most important thing to choose a country is the distance between you live and the school or the university and how much you pay for live in the here
i mean the cost of the life the culture and the person in other country usually is different
i do n't know i mean depends some case of the person is different for someone
the culture and people is important to know how living in other areas is for me is nice to know the people
watching t v and the movies and practice with other people in other countries so when i have to opportunity to practice with other persons for the job i get
maybe the student needs to knows the work
the factories start their production and producing the pollutions and this particulars are in smoke after the acid particulars has carried by wind maybe this mix with the cloud and precipitations
is important the eating habits because normal the person eating bad and no vegetables only bad food
yes but never practice exercise every day i try to running all days but is not easy for me
yeah the normal people every people say about the you need eight hour to sleeping
i think that there are many different reasons for learning about other countries but i think that the main reasons are the language and the culture that you can learn
in my free time i really enjoy reading textbooks about philosophy and about sciences like physics and also of course i like to hang out with friends
i would say that the best way to improve my english is speaking speaking with friends and with people that only can speak in english
i definitely would learn to play an instrument i really like the guitar and i would like to perform my favourite songs by pink floyd and other rock groups
well i would say that the advantage are very clear i think that the students that have to work they have more money and in this way they do n't have to depend on their parents the disadvantage i think that is the less time that they have to rest and to hang out with friends or something like that in my opinion i would say that each person have to do what they want in this case i think that it is possible to do the two things at the same time so i do n't see a problem
the first step in the production of the acid rain is the pollution that comes from factories and vehicles in that situation some acid particles falls as dust contamining lakes and other acid particles mix with cloud and fall in form of water damaging the trees and the environment
my advice is that people have to control their diet
i think that drinking water is fundamental not only for keeping a healthy lifestyle but it is fundamental for the life
obviously i think that it is not essential to do exercise every day but i think that it is very important that you can do exercise the most times that you can
yes i am agree with that because sleep well is essential to be rested during your day and to perform the best of you in work and with your family
i think that technology have neither positive nor negative consequences in our life i think that all these question depends on the use of each person do to technology
i 'm very interested
i like to read books
practising more the speaking
speak english
actually this is a complicated topic because of course you can find advantages and disadvantages the advantage is that the student can get some experience in the time that he 's studying but the disadvantage in my point of view it 's that maybe this person can lose the focus on the studies so this could be complicated
i do not have a huge experience regarding acid rain however from what i can see on the picture i can understand that the pollution came from the vehicles and the factories it goes up in the air and it could be carried from the wind so part of these particles will fall as a dust directed in the environment nearby and part of these can be mixed with the cloud waters and then it 's the way where the acid rain it 's formed so this could be damage the environment a little bit far than when it 's carried just as a dust
the advice that i can give the people who wants to have better eating habits is that they should increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that they are eating and reduce the amount of sugar
yes i do believe that doing exercise daily is a way to improve your health not just your body health but also your mental health so for me that 's something everyone should do in a daily basis
i think that in my case for example i do need eight hours of sleep every night however maybe can exist people who needs less and i think it 's fine i think that people should sleep as much as they need
i think the technology topics it 's like depends of the way that the people are using technology i mean everythings in life needs balance and also the technology
well i 'm pretty interested about learning about other countries about different cultures and the different traditions that they have there
i do n't have that much of free time but i would like to spend it with my friends and family loved ones in general and i really like to you know read books and that
and also i would say watching movies and t v series really helps me to improve my english and also reading books helps me watching different videos on youtube
i would really like to play a new instrument i play two instruments right now and i would like to start a new one it 's a persian traditional instrument
well the advantages of students working is that they could have an extra money for what they need and it will help them with the money but the disadvantages are that they would have less time for example doing their homeworks or they would be tired in the end of the day and they will have less energy to do their homeworks and study for the university
well this is a diagram that how factories and vehicles can cause damage to environments first of all they make this pollution which has acid particles in this smoke and the wind can carry these acid particles through the air and some of these particles fall down as dust and may pollute the water and some other will go through the clouds and will make acidic water which comes down to the ground as rain or snow
i would definitely say people that do not skip the breakfast do not start your day without getting your breakfast and also i could say that eat more fruits and vegetables and also less sugar
well it 's really important to drink enough water because it 's really affects our body and our brain specially you need to drink a glass of water in the morning coz you wake up really dehydrated after sleep
well doing exercises is really important but i do n't think that it 's so necessary to do it every day but it would be really nice if you take exercises like three days a week or more or less how much you can in your lifestyle
well i agree with them scientific researches shows that it 's really necessary for our brain to take that sleep overnight it 's really necessary for its function
i ca n't give you a firm answer like yes or no but technology has affect our lifestyles in many way it has some benefits and some disadvantages you should know how to manage it
i am really interested because i would like to travel for some months and it 's important for me to know languages to know another cultures and what is important for the other countries
in my free time i usually play guitar and piano and also like to reading books and another important activity is to walk and running with my dogs
so it 's important to know their expressions or the sound what they talk
i would like to learn about chemistry i think it 's important to know about what happen around us
to have a part time job while you 're studying can have some advantage like for example with that salaries you can pay your studies or for example your future studies but also that can have a lot of disadvantage like for example you can have enough time to do homework or you can have enough time to spend with family or with friends or for example to do another kind of activities you can have focus in studying and maybe you can lose out the opportunity of studying
that pollution can turn in acid particles and are in the air these particles travel in the air and in the wind and can convert in acid particulars that fall in the dust or another kind of particles that can be in the snow and the rain that kind of particles can fall in the forest and damage the environment
some advices that i can tell you are avoiding fast food and you can eat another kind of foods like for example vegetables fruits that can have a good percentage of water in it
well we 're a great percent of wateer in our bodies so it 's important that our body is hydrated for do the different activities around the day
not every day i think that doing exercise some days a weeks are essential to have a healthy lifestyle because the body needs to movement the muscles need the movement
i think that the sleeping is necessary i do n't know because your feel tired all the day
well in a positive way i can say that industries are developing all the time new machines and new technology for health
yeah i 'm living in the hall of our university which is for two people in the room and currently i just live near my university which is really convenient for me to go to school and to the class and also it 's very convenient to go to work
i 'm really just spending time with my boyfriend during my weekend and weekdays because he is a really good man which is can keeping me really relaxed during his life and also i 'd like to say that he 's the best one
a banker in the investment bank which have a high salary and also working in the c b d which i admire a lot
many students get jobs to pay for their university studies and the advantages of this is that if they joined these activities they can improve their work experience and they can get a much great position if they graduate from school and join the work and the other advantage is that if they take part in these activities they can have to earn a lot of money and it can ease the tension in finance so they can take more attention to their subject and the disadvantage is that if they spend a lot of money in getting their jobs they will have less time to join their subjects and work on their majorities and in my opinion it 's not good to get jobs to pay for their university studies because it can keep them from having a good study
you should travel to the airport by car by bus or by underground and you should get to the departure centre and check in if you see the assistant then next step is that you can wait in the departure centre there are cafe and shopping centre also toilet and restaurant are included in it and when you hear the announcement on board you should go to the gate and board the airplane and the next step you can leave
i consider learning to teachers face to face is the best way because they can communicating with the other people face to face and they can learn their gesture and their also facial expressions
they can learn to express themselves on facial expression and also their body gestures
i think that is of great importance to build learning facilities because it can make the students to freedomly use the learning facilities and enrich their experience on learning on themselves which can help them to work better after graduation
i 'm very interesting to learning about other countries
i watching series and search about how i can learn english very well
practicing and speaking it to another one watching the series with the subtitle english and learning a new vocabulary and talking to people and the listening everything in english
the advantages of part time jobs for student while they are studying they can have money to collect the fees of their university disadvantages is they ca n't have time enough to study but in my opinion they should have a part time job to have the new experience and money to sponsor their studies
i will talk about acid rain then this will carried by wind then some acid particles fall as dust and the others acid particles mix with cloud water then this acid will in rain or snow when this come in the earth that will damage to environment that 's it
my advice is they should search for healthy food and they take it in their fridge on all the time so he will have healthy eating habits
it 's very important drink lots of water for their body and their skin to have a healthy lifestyle the water it 's very important thing
in my opinion it is not important to doing exercise every day it 's enough to doing exercise three days in the week that 's it that 's my opinion
i agree with that opinion because our bodies need eight hours in the day to wake up in the morning with a healthy body
i think that technology has generally a positive effect of people health because they can use it to affect their lifestyle to make it 's more healthy
it is in the province of buenos aires in argentine
i enjoy swimming walking on the beach or walking around mountains or sometimes i read or take a walk around the city
it 's my wife of course
i would like to be a developer i am studying for this in a course by my computer
the advantage are you acquire experience you earn your own money and you know the real world the experience is for me very important in this step of your life the disvantage are that you have less time to study you can feel tired to do both studying and working and you have more responsibilities in my opinion is positive because it is a transition from another way of life it is useful to find a job when you finish your career i think you have to do this
well the first thing you have to do when you travelling by airplane is to go to the air station by taxi or a bus or train you have to check in at the customer office and give the ticket then you have to pass immigration you have to show you document and then pass the security port they check all your bags all you have to put on then you have to wait for the departure at the gate they are indicated to you and then board the plane and make it fly
students can use technology to look up for articles and news discoveries about their study it 's useful to do it
i think so face to face is the logical way to study and the teacher can correct you at the moment and they can find a way you study better
working on group project is how you work in real life and you have to develop some part of the project it 's how to acquire more information and it 's better for you
i think reading alone it 's better because you can reread what you are reading and you can investigate in the web what are you reading
it 's very important today because facilities are improving day by day and you have to know the news technologies for learning
i am very much interested about learning other countries
i enjoy my free time by watching netflix
i want to speak as much as i can so that i can improve my english
i want to do master 's in english literature so that i can speak and listen and write very well and even i can teach other people
according to me university students should do part time jobs while they 're studying but some students are just want to study they do n't want to do part time jobs and the advantages are they can save more money for their future and for their future studies and sometimes there are like disadvantages because they do n't find much time to get their studies and in my opinion doing a job with studying is very much beneficial and it also motivates the student and also boost up the student 's level and he or she feels more independent
according to me as we can see acid rain is very much dangerous because it causes the air pollution through the vehicles and you can see some of the acid particles are carried away in the smoke so it is very bad in nature
they have to avoid that
drinking lots of water increases the immunity even it glows the skin and you can feel very much energetic and it will also maintain your water level in your body so drinking water is very beneficials of one health
yes it is very much essential to do some basic exercises because by doing some kind of fitting exercises anyone can feel energetic happy and the body will be flexible all the day
yes according to me also sleeping eight hours is a very good hobby or it 's a very good thing and everyone should take this sleep
technology always is a good thing because we are knowing about the different technologies we are increasing our economical growth also and through technologies we can easily talk to each other so it 's a good thing but if it use in a good manner
well i interest by culture and language and traditions and people in general
well i really really really like it watch movies or series i like the k dramas like k series and sometimes read books
well actually watch movies or series in english for practice
i will like someday to learn speak korean but i need to learn english first because most of the materials are in english so i need learn english
first of all i think that i am an expert in this topic because i have a friend who do part time jobs and she are studying right now so i say she what difficult is to do part time jobs while you 're a student and what are the advantage i think that one advantage it 's that you have more money for pay your studies but what are the disadvantage that you do n't have enough time to focus on your studies so it 's difficult and in my opinion i think that it 's not a good idea found or search part time jobs while you are a student because you have to focus on your studies right now
the pollution is a serial problem in our world and the worst part is that we are part of this because all the pollution begin in the factories or vehicles so they have two steps one of them is some acid particles fall as a dust over lakes and seas and other acid particles mix with cloud water and acid particles are rain or snow and they 're so evil for our planet
actually i 'm not the right person to give advice of eating habits to other people because i think that i do n't have good habits with the food but i think that one advice is that you eat balanced
it 's very very important to drink water all of day because our brain needs water to work good
well i think not every day because it 's too much yeah it 's important do exercise some days of the weekend like the three or two or four days on the week
i think that it 's fifty fifty because technology has good things but i think that have bad things too
it could be a good plan for me maybe at the future
i enjoy spending my free time reading i like to reading novels especially i like to visit my parents and spending my time with my family and you know with friends and maybe watching some series and listening to music
the best way for me to improve my english is reading i think reading is the best way or to listening is a good way too watching some series and obviously like trying to do this speaking with a different person even when is a robot
it would be painting i love painting frames but i 'm no as good as an artist but i like like the different colors painting i would love to do it and improve that skills i think it 's artistic it could be an excellent skill to have
as my point of view the advantage for students doing part time jobs is that they have their money to do many things or maybe buy commodities i do n't know to paying that that is important because you know that students most of the time are running out of money and they need to buy their own clothes or maybe things that they need the disadvantages is that they are worrying about many things like working produce money doing many things and not investing time and preparing theirselves to maybe get that degree or something related to that that is my opinion but i think is important to get like experience that is a really important part
this is my presentation about acid rain and at the beginning acid rain is produced by factories and vehicles the wind moves this acid particles or this acid particles are carried by wind some of this fall as a dust and others mix with a water in the cloud water for example and the situation of this is this acid rain move over the world and the atmosphere that it moves with the wind for example and then get down as a rain you know or snow and that could be damage the environment that is the situation
thinking in what they are eating is the most important you know like the quantity of food is important to create this kind of a healthy habit
it is really important as far as i know people would drink like two litres of water per day i do n't like drinking too much water but i know that is necessary to moisturise your skin and everything
as my point of view doing exercise will be enough like three times per week according with many specialists that will be good for your muscles and to keep moving your body it will be good just that
i think that is correct you have to sleep at least eight hours as an adult person because that is the moment that your body recovery from many things even some ills or maybe stress are produce by people do n't sleep very well
i think it could be both you know that will be good but for the other side would be negative
i enjoy reading watching t v series and thinking in my free time
nowaday university students should do part time jobs while they study they 're learning their own lesson the advantages are student have money to do part time job
today i would like to talk about acid rain becoming a acid rain at first the acid rain is become from pollution and acids particle fall as dust and other acids particle mix with cloud water and then acids particle are in rain and snow so acid particle in the fall of the earth environment the trees and the trees and the environment are damage
oh drinking water is more vital in our life drinking water is more important to our life
doing exercise is good if you do n't do exercise you ca n't have a healthy heart
everyone is sleeping usually seven hours or eight hours in a day
the technology has pros and cons
i have always enjoyed playing football however now i 'm thinking of taking up volleyball in holidays
i like spending time with my sister because is similar to me we always playing football together and we have a great time together
in the future i would like to be as auditor because i 'm study business i am a lover of business so i think it could be my dream job
it is a good question and it has got a lot of advantages for example they can earn money to spend in their activities or hobbies they can be able to work furthermore we can know all about this job in spite of that they could lose a lot of time furthermore they could n't be able to study and they wo n't have any free time for this reason i believe that parents must to pay their university studies to their childrens because i think it has got this obligation
hi first of all we must to travel to airport by car or by bus or by train when we will arrive to airport we must to do the check in we must to show the document control to the police and suddenly we must to pass the control of security
students could use technology in differents ways for example they can search a lot of information to study
i love working in a group project because we can learn how to work in team furthermore we can improve our relationship with our classmates
it is a good question but i believe that it is depending on the person on the one hand some people prefer attending lectures on the other hand some people prefer to read alone
i think that school with modern facility their student will learn more faster than other schools without these facilities
i love travelling and learning new things so maybe a hundred percent i 'd say
i also write blogs and articles
i need to be surrounded in english such as reading or listening and also speaking in english
definitely my communication skill because i 'm quite insecure about my speaking skills so i want to improve that especially in my english speaking skill
i have nothing against university students doing part time jobs actually it 's very good for them and ya disadvantages of course most of them does n't have enough time to study or to sleep and to rest well so in my own opinion it 's an advantage it 's like ninety percent advantage and ten percent disadvantage
smokes from vehicles and factories are the most common factors or contributors to air pollution then in the smokes there are acid particles and of course when it is carried by the wind some of the acid particles fall as dust and it also contributes to the pollution to the environment and that is how acid rain created
people who want to develop eating habits should first have self discipline and be consistent in their plan about eating healthy foods avoid eating salty foods junk foods and try eating more vegetables especially the green ones
drinking lots of water gives us a lot of benefits it 's very beneficial to our body because it cleanse the toxins and unnecessary you know toxins in our body
most of the people does n't have time to exercise every day regularly but doing exercise more frequently can help our body to become strong and our bones to be more strong and flexible
eight hours of sleep every night is actually a good sleep
it really depends on the usage of technology because nowadays technology is also used in medication purposes
i am so interest because travel it is one of my favourite hobbies
in my free time i usually practice at sports and during the weekend i go out with my friends sometimes to the cinema or sometimes having dinner
i think that it 's a strange thing that i have n't got this capacity and if i can i would
the advantages of have part time is that you do n't depend on the money your parents give to you and it is a very big disadvantage is that you have less time to study or do things of the interest
and acid particles are in air and wind will move them
having well eat habits makes that your health improve
water is the only drink people must drink so as much water as you drink better health you will have
in my personal case i practice sport five or six days at week so if i were them i will do at least three or four times a week
i think that it 's an amount that it 's unbelievable in my case i sleep from six to seven hours and i rest
i think that in a balance because it has its good things and worse things for example take phone
on holidays i like to spend my time on running and making some cuisines and cleaning my rooms and washing in the laundry
oh it 's a difficult questions but the mostly my wife is a person that i love to spend with
and that 's it
okay let me explain the jobs all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies and second one and the disadvantages of those activity is to lose their time to study in their university so every students have to do their jobs for some extent to pay for their university study at least partially not everything
so first you have to do is to travel to airport by car or bus or public transportation to reach the airport after getting to airport you have to go to in check in counter to check in in the table and then go to security to your hand bags and other thing and after security you 're going to wait for some minutes or some hours before boarding the plane and after boarding the train the plane will go to your destination
in order to be more effective to study the technology can help
i agree the opinion too
i think the communication skills and the motivation skills will be developed through group projects
i m my opinion attending lectures are important and more effective for studying because being attending in the lectures you can communicate with teachers and your colleagues in the class
i enjoy be playing with my son and watch t v or see the social networks and study english
i think the best way is practice every day the language and grammatic and listening the videos in english
i think the advantages is about the responsibilities because the students development new skills on the works in my opinion it is necessary the students learning equilibrate both areas the students and jobs because have experience in the work but is students
the environmenting pollution are consequently about the different pollution source as factory bicycles and we humans the pollution produces acid rained and that is consequently the particulate acid particulate in the wind the acid rained affect the plants water and the quality life of the humans the animals and other species in the earth
i think the workout is fundamental for the healthy living but i think the body need a rest sometimes but the doing exercise is important
i think that is true but sometime it is difficult to keep all the seven and eight hours in the night but it is through
depend of the use but fundamentally it 's positive
i am very very interested in learning about other countries and cultures
in my free time i like to watch movies read some books go to the beach go to the park with my daughters
i think the best way to improve my english is speaking and learning all about the grammar and trying to speak with other persons
at this moment i 'm trying to learn to be a pilot
in my opinion there is no disadvantages in working part time while studying in university
to begin with we can see in these pictures vehicles and factories emitting carbon dioxide causing pollution and emitting acid particles in the smoke these acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles goes down as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water then the acid particles goes down in rain or snow and causes damage to the environment
for the people who wants to develop good habits about eating the first thing to do is forgetting the junk food it is the worst thing to the human body
it is very very important to drink water all day long because all of our systems our body systems needs water to work in the correct way
of course doing exercise is very important for maintain the healthy of your body but doing exercise every day could be very difficult for some people
there is no magic number of time of sleeping every day what you have to think is each one have your personal time to sleep and feel healthy in the next day
there are many ways to think about this question in one way technology has improved the healthy treatments
i find it very interesting to know about their cultures or their architecture and i enjoy to travel to other countries
i enjoy my free time with my cat also i design some clothes and make these clothes with technique of crochet
in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing with other people that know the language also i believe that writing and reading some text is useful
i would learn about the grammar and also i would like feel more comfortable when i 'm improve my english
but it has actually some disadvantage such as loss of time of enjoying time such as having a free time for our friends or something like that
this is a presentation about an actual issue that is the formation of acid rain it is caused by vehicles or factories then in the three step this acid particles are carried by wind and in this part we have two options first some acid particles fall as dust but other particles mix with cold water therefore this acid particles are in rain or snow and it causes damage to our environment this is an important issue and actually is the most important
in my opinion having a good lifestyle starts since our eating habits so personally i could say that consult with a specialist is the best way to start with these good eating habits
as far as i know experts recommend that in our daily routine we should drink a minimum of two water litres
yeah in my opinion the exercise is the best way to keeping healthy doing exercise have a lot of advantage such as loss mass as well as keep a good lifestyle
as far as i know experts recommend that have about six to eight hours to sleep is enough
in my opinion currently the technology has been part of our daily routine so personally i would like to say that technology have a positive effect in the society develop
i like to play some games i like to watch movies i like go to the gym
but the one of disadvantages is about time you do n't have much time to dedicated yourself for studying improve yourself you know it 's my personal opinion about it is if you can you do n't need to do part time jobs you know i think it 's good way is focus in the studies
hey everyone i will go ahead with my presentation about acid rain and i will show the diagram about it the first one start with the pollution this pollution get from vehicles and factories and then the particles is from pollution and then it 's carried by wind it damage all environment
a good advice about eating habits is to transform your own life into more health and consequently the life is good because eating habits is essential for human lives
absolutely doing exercise every day it 's essential for humans it 's the same for eating and drink water programmatically but doing exercise is one of the most important things to do now of life
i think technology is a good ally because their help us to do great things like drink doing sleeping and the exercise for a good health lifestyle you know but i think it 's good
i think that the environment is the most important thing in the world and i always participate in some activities to protect our environment
on the weekend we enjoyed playing badminton together because this sport not only stress our bodies but also we will have a good time there and i have a good command of playing badminton
i think it 's my mom we both have two big eyes and not only the outlook but also we are very friendly and patient to do everything
i want to live in hong kong in the future because hong kong is an open and inclusive city and i will get a well paid job there
now i 'm going to talking about the students do fitness classes in the college but the disadvantages are obviously too first some students may not fit for their fitness classes because they have a weak body and then they will get hurt in the fitness classes so in my opinion i recommend the fitness classes in the colleges because nowadays the students need to get more and more exercise in their school
today i 'm going to talk about how honey is produced first of all the bees will collect nectar from flowers then in the beehives the bees make honey from nectar together when the honey is formed the beekeepers will collect honey from beehives then the beekeepers will pour the honey into bottles then after that there are some vehicles transform the bottoms of honey to the shops finally on the shops will give the price and put them into the case so we can buy them
in my opinion they should consider about the fees when studying abroad and the conception level because the money is the most important thing and the locals ' different culture is important too
i think having a good command of second language will help you have a better communication with other people in their countries and when you in different countries you will speak easily to other people
in my opinion i think the most difficult thing is the local language because it is not the mother language for most students studying abroad and the second one is the local different culture it 's very different from us
i think they can learn the local culture by reading some books which about local histories and they will also go to the internet and search some information about the history
i agree with them because when you study abroad just yourself you will learn many life skills which can help you become more independent and you will not depend too much on your parents for money and something else
i think the best way to learn english is by listening broadway musicals it is important to listen music but i think broadway musical can use difficult structure that you can emit or mimic them so you could improve it
i think that i would like to learn how to drive because in my town there 's a lot of traffic so it is difficult to move on to one place to another one so for example i 'm not ready to work for that reason because i am live far from other places
i think that part time jobs are a good idea where students from university could learn new skills that they could n't learn in the school so for example i think some areas of those advantages are you could talk better and you have confidence when you have a presentation for other part some disadvantages is that you are more busy and you do n't have time to spend with your free time or you can spend with social things but in my opinion i think that is important to have a balance your life
the smoke of those gases could be mixed with acid particles and those acid particles can be carried by the wind and that in the wind the particles can fall as a dust and other ones could be mixed with the cloud and the clouds are water i could say that but the dread part of that is mixed with the clouds is that it 's coz the rain and the snow could falling as an acid rain
i am not a nutrologist but i could tell you that is important to have a balance when you 're eating you have to meat fish or something that can bring you protein and you also have to eat fruits and vegetables and preferably you have to eat dish of different color
i am not sure at all but i think that the minimum that you must have to drink is three liters of water but if you are a sports trainer you must have to drink more than three liters of water because it will be affect your brain or your training if you do n't drink
i think that is important to make exercise and also is important to organise your schedule for example you have to do minimum three hours per week
that 's true is important to sleep eight hours
i do n't think that technology is a problem but some people think that it is because you must have to organise your schedule also when you 're napping or doing exercise
exactly interested in learning about other countries
watching the movie
speaking with native speaker who ca n't corrected my mistake
all university students should do part time jobs why they are studyings what are the advantages disvantages and what is your own opinion yeah advantages is that they can earn for that them a uni fees and that they are well fed and my own opinions that they can do the part time jobs while they are studying hard work more
and this acids particles are in the smoke and then they have been in the skies by the wind and the acid particles are carried by the wind so we need to review the factories ' and vehicles ' pollution
for good eating habits they need to eat healthy food and not fast food in it is contained a lot of salt and fat and they need to avoid it
of course doing the exercise and every day at least half an hour to an hour is quite important for the human body
yeah and eight hours sleeping times is essential for the every human beings and that they can have the some sleep and that they can have restores their energy and they 're refresh for the next days and their physical exercise or the mental
besides it has a great views since i live near a old lake with animals such as ducks turtles and fish

i love to hang out with her because i like to teach her good things besides we love animals i hope that in the future she and i have the same relationship
after finishing my degree in biotechnology i would like to work in a laboratory or in a research centres
i will talk about an especial topic topic is all students should get jobs to pay for their university students well from my point of view this has many advantages is more the student become more independent about the disadvantages maybe the student do n't have time for other activities it 's ok is for a good reason and from my point of view in my opinion i think is a good opportunity for all the students is great
first of you need an transport to travel to airport for example in taxi in car on train on bus i do n't know the important is that you arrive to airplane then the employee is going to check in your passport and other man is going to check your document this is for security and control after that you must wait in the sales while you wait you can drink a coffee eat go to the bathroom pass the time you going to board the airplane
currently the technology is very important of the life because with technology you can learn about different topic
well in my point of view i think is the best way to learn for me is face to face

yeah of course
i am really interested in other countries each country has their own pieces of food or buildings and i think it 's so interesting
i like to play video games and meet with friends
the best way to improve your english is to practice a lot
i would like to learn about karate it 's a really interesting sport and can help you in difficult situations where you need to defend yourself
working while studying it 's a common decision every students has to deal with once time at least in its lives on the one hand paying your university degree can be very expensive and that 's why working while studying could be really useful for people but on the other hand it could takes too much time and you could not have enough time to prepare correctly your exams so i think the most important is to prepare your studies correctly and leave your work for later for in the future
nowadays air pollution is such a very important problem in our society and the smoke they produce contains acid particles that are spread out by the wind then some of them fail and contaminating our lakes and rivers and some others mix with cloud water and at raining time they fall to our forest damaging our environment
my advice is to reduce their consume of fast food and start to eat five meals per day is very important to obtain strength to your bodies
it is very important to drink a lots of water our bodies are compose about ninety percent of water so we need to drink a lot in order to be healthy
absolutely doing exercise every day reduce our possibilities of having a disease and make us to gain some strength and exercise our bodies
it is very very important to sleep eight hours every day our bodies needs to rest too much time in order to be able to do its best on our daily life
that is a difficult question on the one hand it has improve our lives making us able to communicate in every situations
it is quite awesome so it is quite peaceful here
i have got three daughters
i would like to be a teacher because i like spending time with children
all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies there are some advantages in this secondly they will get some experience which will help them in their future career on the other hand they will spend some time on their work as a result they will have less time for their studies in my opinion it is quite a good idea for students to get a job to pay for their university studies because they will be more experienced
i have been asked to give the presentation about travelling by airplane so look at this diagram to start with go to check in where your luggage will be weighted and you will have for there boarding pass then go to the document control and to the security if you have done all this and you have time so wait in the cafe or go to the restroom or go to the duty free to buy the presents after that go to border and enjoy your flight
to study more effectively students can use technology they can search additional information and also they can read the different researches about this topic
i think that students can develop cooperation and communication when working together on group project because they study to listen each other
i do n't think that attending lectures is more useful than learning alone you can do this online by yourself and it will be so good as attending lectures if you do it responsibly
i think that it is very important to provide modern learning facilities in the universities because nowadays in the world of high improved technology it is so important to have the modern techniques
i 'm interesting about culture language and food i interesting
i 'm spending my free time to do some exercise or to read some books for example i like it
first of all the infography show us about acid rain and then the wind transport these particles inside the clouds polluting them and then when rain or snow the particles are in rain or snow fall through trees
for me is very important to you should to drink water more or less two or three liters for day
in my opinion is very important to do exercise every day perhaps one day to rest but to do exercise more or less six days is very important
i think i agree with the question is very important to sleep more or less eight hours at night for this reason your body is better
i 'm really interested to learn about canada because i moved to canada a few years ago and here i have a lot of multicultural people and i 'd like to learn a little about each one
i enjoy spending my free time making some cookies and cakes i 'd like to cook a lot and i 'd likely to go shopping and i 'd like to walking too
for me the best way to improve my english is studying a lot i study every single day and to improve my speaking i think i need to speak every time it 's the best way to improve
if i could learn a new skill i think it will be language i start to study english because i move to canada for a few years and i needed to speak in english and i have a passion for language
all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because they have more advantages they gain experience but they have some disadvantages because they do n't have much time to study more
the acidy rains are caused because of factories and vehicles emit some gases and this pollution form acid particles in the smoke and it transform in acid particles and carried by wind and some acidy particles falls as dust and others acidy particles mix with cloud water
it 's very important to drink a lot of water because our body is composed by seven percent of water so you need to drink water to hydratate your body it 's very important to drink to have a good health
yes it 's really important to do exercise every single day
some researches prove that it 's very important to sleep at least eight hours per day
i 'm very interest on learning about other countries because they have different culture and different custom and i think is very helpful know it and practice there in their customs
some days i spend my time reading books and watching series and anime this because that reforce me in my language my vocabulary in english spanish and japanese
i improve my english making many exercise and do the homework read different text like a magazines and books and watch series
and you can communicate their feelings or thoughts you take
all university students should do part time jobs well it 's a big discussion because the advantages are many some of them are the student will have extra money and experience about their job so they can be responsible and honest but the disadvantage of this they do n't have enough time to study their exams and do the homework in my opinion if you do n't have enough time it 's necessary to organisate and try to do work try to give the best of you it 's the best answer in your life the student
this because the factories and vehicles produce pollution one group form the mix with cloud water and the other groups fall as dust the clouds rain or snow over the environment that causes deteriorate the life in that area and produce contamination
you have to good eating habits you need to separate your hours in the day and go to the nutritional or doctor they give you their best plan of this and will help you
for our body is important to drink water because our body is consist seventy percent of water and if you need a healthily style life you need drink more water
maybe one person sleep five hours and the other seven hours
i thinks excess it 's bad but if you want to use the technology of your site is good
i 'm very interested about learning another countries especially england united kingdom
i spend my free time reading cycling doing spinning going to the mountains
i need to improve my speaking english so i am trying to use speaking a p ps
i d like to improve my speaking english
well i am going to talk about if all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying or not well do part time jobs one of the advantage of work do a part time job while you are studying is you can earn money you can help your fathers or the people who is earning your studies
well i 'm going to try to explain how pollution from the factories and the vehicles causes damage to environment
well i think we should eat all kind of foods we should eat no much fats and no much sweets
drink water is very important to be correctly hydratated so we should drink more water regularly during the day
well i think we should do exercise regularly i do n't think every day but i think twice a week or three times a week or more
i think sleep seven or eight hours a day is very important to be healthy
i think technology is bad or is good for people it depends of the used people do of technology
i am very interested in the environment and in keeping it in the best conditions as possible
we love thrifting and we also love going to get a little drink while we thrift it 's very fun because you can find the most amazing pieces ever and they 're also unique we also love just sitting down just enjoying our time in a park just chatting and keeping up with everything
look wise i think my little sister we look very similar like some people really think that she 's my daughter but personality wise i would say my other younger sister yeah
actually would love to live in the u k for a couple of years and then come back home yeah i truly love spain so
i would say yes i personally agree with that statement i think the advantages of that is that if the students that have no time after school to do any type of sport they get an opportunity finally be able to exercise throughout the day plus is also very good for students ' health also the disadvantages i dunno i think that unless somebody has like some sort of physical difficulty that 's the only disadvantage i see and in my opinion i think that that 's great and i think that should be done more
this diagram shows how honey is produced in the first step bees collect nectar from flowers that they find nearby and after that they go to their beehives and they make honey from that nectar that they 've gathered after a while of gathering nectar and transforming it into honey beekeepers collect that honey and they put it into jars and then they ship it to supermarkets where it 's sold to everyone to enjoy
what they should consider is i 'd say the cost of living because if they have enough money to just to live without working they would have to find a place that 's low key cheap so they do n't have to work and study at same time
if you study in a second language you learn that language and i think it 's easy enough always done it so yeah
i think what they might find difficult might be the language if they do n't speak it very fluently or maybe making friends or adapting to the country yeah
they can learn it when they 're going outside with friends to like clubs or if they just visit museums or historical sites or just a simple and nice restaurant where they serve local food that 's also a very great place where you can learn about the local culture
i think it 's true because it gives you the freedom of doing whatever you like and if you make mistakes there is n't really somebody from your family that could help you so it just makes you grow up as a person even if you do n't want to
i am very interesting
i spend my free time reading study english spanish planning travel around the world
speak with another people
so i agree and support this option
at first the factories produces more pollution and this cause acid particles are in smoke and this acid particles are carried by wind and the wind get some articles fall as dust and anothers can mix cloud water this process forming acid rain and this damage to environment
so i think the healthy living is a hard process but i can do this for discipline and share with others that i can do this too
water can help you to think more clarity and sleep more healthy too so drink water that can be hard but that 's so important
oh it depends depends the situation but i think that so much import really really important doing exercises but not every day
have a great quality of sleeping is most important but eight hours for a day that 's hard
that 's a really good question this is amazing and incredible city all the summers it 's crowded by foreign people but in winter it is peaceful this have a lot of palm trees
well that 's an interesting question when i 'm on holidays i always work for earn my own money and i am crazy about playing volleyball with my friends at the beach
well in the future i would like to work like a nurse in london because i think here in spain there are bad conditions and in london the conditions are better
well from my point of view i think there are some advantages to work as waiter for example while you are studying but i think that there are more disadvantages than advantages for example if you are working you do n't have much time from yourself and from your family or your pets even your friends
i am going to explain what you need to do to travel by airplane first of all you need to go to the airport you can go by car by bus or by train and you ca n't call some of your family or your friend to transport you to the airport when you arrive to the airport after this you need to check in in the airport later you should pass the document control this is the more difficult task in the airport because there are a lot of people
from my point of view studying face to face is better than studying with the technology
as far as i 'm concerned attending lectures alone is better than other people because you ca n't concentrate in your own better
i think if the university support learning facility to the students they could be have a great favour to student
i 'm quite interested because i use my english for everyday tasks in my job i have to work with people from different countries from europe so that 's why i need to use my english in my job time so it 's important for me
i especially enjoy my free time going out with my friends because what i hate the most is the loneliness i can not imagine my last days of my life alone
as i said before i have to use my english in my job time so that 's the best way of improving my english is practicing at my projects because i have to work with people from different countries in europe so i have to improve my english
i am sure that it would be learning chinese because when i have to look for data sheets of products that are sold in china maybe you have to contact chinese people
i am quite sure that students doing part time jobs while they are studying have more pros than cons because we have to spend a lot of our time on the lifetime working so it 's better to understand how enterprises work
hello everybody i 'm here to talk about acid rain cycle that this cycle begins in factories and vehicles producing pollution when they are working so they create smoke and this acid particles are inside this smoke so that goes up unto the sky and creates some clouds mixed with water so when wind they move this clouds to the forest or to the rural areas and it starts raining that particles goes down with the water and they produce some damages to the environment specially trees and water inside the lakes
i would tell them to create a good schedule for your meals specially when your day starts you have to eat good sugar and some fat because you need energy for your daytime
according to my opinion i think everybody should do exercise every day because the jobs right now nowadays are very boring so we are stuck in our chairs and in front of computers
i disagree this opinion because i think that not everybody needs the same amount of sleeping time because for example i only need six hours seven hours to just stay good for my daytime and not eight hours as i need it
but right now using augmented reality or something like that you can use technology to keep on moving
i am extremely interested in lear learning about other countries
well i think there are different ways to improve my english through watching videos through writing on websites and through daily reading
okay if i had the chance to learn a new skill i would go for learning cooking because i think it helps me in different ways like in my real life and yeah
ok first of all let me talk about the advantages when students do part time jobs they will have enough money they earn enough money for their studies and they can earn enough money for you know for things that they can buy and they will also get familiar with responsibilities they knows how to be a responsible person when doing part time jobs and this also prepares them for their life as well however there are some disadvantages for part time jobs as well first of all the students will not have enough time for their study and for their leisure time and personally i think part time jobs are necessary since it prepares students for their life
ok talking about the diagram we can come to this conclusion that acid rain are exceedingly dangerous for the environment and it is because of the pollution and in some parts it falls down to the rivers again and the rest of it is carried to the clouds which eventually becomes water and it rains into the environment or into the ground and it damages the ground because it is polluted and it is not safe for the environment
okay i think they need to have a very healthy eating habits like they need to include some vegetables fruits and some you know low fat food in their eating habits
okay naturally it 's very important to drink water since it has a lot of advantages
i profoundly agree with them because sleeping it is absolutely vital for every person
i think it depends on people some people use it in a negative way which has negative effects on them however some people use it in a very positive way which has got positive impacts on their lifestyle
it is said that the environment is very important to take into account because of the fact that it has a lot of big problems such as the pollution nowadays
it is said that friends are a good and important part of your life
although there are some people that say that i 'm more similar to my mother i think that i 'm more similar to my father because we like to do the same thing such as watch films or read books
if i have to choose i would choose to live in another country because it 's important to me get experiences and know other cultures other languages of other places so if could i would live and job for example in london
it has both pros and cons on the one hand the advantages could be that the students of schools and colleges should get or keep fit because of the fact that some scientific studies say that we must obtain some proteins or nutrients for our brain because our brains is working during the day and we need this substances to make a good connection between the brain and our body oh and on the other hand the disadvantages could be that the students have less time to study their units so to sum up in my opinion it 's important to have time for all these type of activities
if you want to know how honey comes from flower and go to the shop i 'm going to explain it first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and bees make honey from nectar in beehives so this type of animal is said to be the most important animal in the planet because without them the planet could die secondly the beekeepers collected the honey from beehives in order to taking to a recipient that is called jars by the end of the process they will have taken into a car where a person transport these type of recipient to a supermarket a shop and there the people could buy this honey and take this food to their homes
if i were them i would choose a country where i could speak the language for example u s a or london something like that because i could communicate with other people and it 's easier to me and other country where the meteorology is similar like the country where they came from
first of all the advantage of study a second language is that you can communicate with other people for example you can travel to more countries because you know another language and you can understand what other persons say to you
the difficulty of studying in another country from my point of view is that you do n't have your family near so if you want them near or you need them you only could call them with your mobile phone or something like that
if you study in another country you must go outside and learn about the culture by different ways for example in order to know this type of culture you could visit monuments or church or festivities
because of the fact that you are outside from my point of view you become more independent because you have to do all by yourself you do n't have your family near your friends near so if you want something you have to obtain it alone so this is the reason why you become more independent
i 'm inclined to reading novels which can allow me step into the fantastic world that the books provides so when i have free time i like to reading novels which also can provide me a sense of comfort and relaxed
i like to spend time with my husband because we share the same interests for example we like to watch movies whenever we watch movie which can also make us feel relaxed so i like to spend leisure time with my husband
i want to be the teacher because i think teacher is a meaningful job just a single word can transform the person 's life
if students want to use technoledge to study more effectively here comes some ways the first of all they can use chat g b t to help them to revise their writing essays
i think if possible students should learn face to face from the teachers here come some reasons
i think if students can work by group project they can learn the communicating skills in order to achieve the same goal they should learn how to compromise and the communicate with their group members
sure it 's really nice place it has really nice living conditions and it has everything you need from supermarkets to recreational centres
as most of my holidays will be in summer i really like swimming because it 's i think a really enjoyable way to spend my time you know swimming has already been enjoyable so i like doing it
i think i would say my mom because most of our opinions are in same agreement which is why i really like talking to her and i can ask any questions i need and she can have information about it
i would like to be a businessman as it 's been my ambition since my childhood to start a business yeah
it 's argued by many people that all students should get occupations to pay for their university studies on their own it has several advantages main of them is that they get the experience of working in a workplace and they have extra pocket money and they do not need to ask money for their parents but the jobs in their free time may not leave enough time for their university studies which is why i think it 's better for them to get jobs after finishing their degree
people who want to travel by aeroplane need to go through several stages they are first of all they obviously need to travel to airport and then they go to check in after their documents will be checkeds and following this they go to security and once they pass they go to the waiting room in that room they can have meals or go to toilet or something and they finally go on board to get ready for the flight
so i think technology has good impact on studying
i also think that face to face learning is the best way of studying because the students who are face to face studying will be under supervision because not every student are able to study without supervision
no i do n't think so because attending lectures have always seemed boring to students so i think reading alone can be much more effective way of studying
i think it 's really important for universities to provide their students with modern learning facilities because if they are not up to date it can have bad impact on their students ' productivity
well i 'm pretty interested in learning other countries coz i like travelling so i think to learn other countries gives me a better learning about other countries ' culture and i 'd like to travelling and see other scenery and like to make friends from all over the world
well if it does n't rain outside i 'd like to take a walk near the riverbank or just have a walk dog
i guess it must be speaking coz you know learning a foreign language and stuff the most important part is to speaking coz while you are speaking you may have some mistakes and the process of solving the mistakes what helps you to improve yourself a lot
i suppose it might be to learn how to play the piano coz i 've already know how to play the violin and i really love music and i think play piano is very you know very graceful and i think that must be a wonderful thing
first i 'd like to explain the advantages as we all know that do part time jobs will give us more experience to work in the society and you know the university students they are nearly to be a society member and that will give them some money and give them more ways to get the money to pay for their life but there are also some disadvantages coz that might be a very distraction things and maybe the students can be cheating the social while they are doing the part time jobs coz they 're still students and they do n't have much rich social life experience
for the pollutions turn into the acid rain and finally damage to the environment there are six steps in their turning and while the the wind has come and the acid particles are carried by the wind and then some of them fall as dust and they will dirty the lake or the soil and other acid particles mix with cloud and water which will just turn into rain or snow but in the end they also may fall into as dust and they will damage the trees the soil the land or the lake
first of all we need to eating regularly and we need to avoid to eat more junk food like hamburgers or eat more sugar or oil
well i think that depends coz we 're not the professional sporters so i think doing the exercise regularly is very important because that will keep us better shape and make us healthy in both physically and mentally i think
well i think that depends you know coz you know the quality of our sleeping is the most important thing so i think is important to have a great sleep environment instead of the time we sleep and i think eight hours ' sleep is also a great thing i think
i think generally speak i think it 's bigger than it negative coz i think nowadays we go to the hospital and we just take some c t or other science equipment to test our body cells and that 's very convenient
i love the summer in summer i have holidays and i like the sun and the sea and in the summer it 's more easier to look the sea and going to the sea
it 's very important for because in my job i must know about the last news and i love the economy and i like to read about economy
i love the nature and for a child i walk for the nature and for the mountains and i love running too and i love running for the mountains and i can see wild animals
i love my actually but in the future i would like to design new motorbikes for an important motorbikes company for example ducati and i would like buy bikes for me
it 's good the students can learn a lot of new skills and they can look like their future jobs will be but on the other hand the students have little free time and then the students must to rest and they must be focusing in their degree it 's a positive idea for me
tunes net began very very bad because the one day they had twenty thousand visits but they improved because in the seven day they had one hundred thousand visits on the other hand music now begin very very good but they did not improve because in the seven day they had eighty thousand visitors
and he must have good social skills and he must be a good talker for communicate his decisions
the disagree many times are positives because it highlight new solutions and it 's the best form for to solve difficult problems
and when the conversation are not face to face it 's more difficult
but for solving difficult problem it 's need many people
i would love to learn about other countries their traditions their heritage and their cultures also food habits
i love to spend my free time with my family reading books and swimming
the best way to improve my english speaking skills are by reading english newspapers by listening to english news channels and to speak in english daily
students studying in universities should do part time jobs the advantages are they can be financially free they can earn their living expenditures there are also disadvantages in part time jobs like concentrating on their academics however i prefer to work to do part time jobs along with concentrating on their academics
factories and vehicles do consume fuels and generate smoke this smoke is called pollution this smoke goes up into the air and this smoke contains acid particles the acid particles are carried by the wind and towards the sky few particles fall back towards the ground like dust and other particles would mix up with the cloud and fall back to the ground in the form of rainfall or snowfall this rainfall also on snowfall damages the environment
i want to advise the people who are willing to develop their eating habits to eat only green leafy vegetables and fruits and mainly they should avoid junk food
