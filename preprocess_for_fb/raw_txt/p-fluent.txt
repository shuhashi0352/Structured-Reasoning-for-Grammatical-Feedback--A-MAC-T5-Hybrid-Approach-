well to be honest that i 'm not a big fan of environment but however i 'm still care about the environment and trees and animals
i suppose to be similar to my sister because she is near my age and we have some very related topics like we both enjoy playing games and computers
my whole life i 've been living in damascus syria but in the future i 'm planning to get a nationality in canada and i 'm also planning to reside there for the rest of my life
having the fitness classes is a very critical thing students should keep their health and wellness in its best part because they are in the best age of health they have to focus on that age to do many sports and to do other workouts actually on the other hand it has some disadvantages for example you know it might take their time you know schools does n't have that amount of time my opinion is definitely to do fitness classes inside the school
hello everyone in today 's presentation we are going to talk about honey and how it 's produced so we are going to tell you how it 's going from flower to your hand and how it 's produced first bees collect the nectar from flowers then they return to the bee hives and make the honey using the nectar when they are finished beekeepers collect the honey from the bee hives then those honey are stored in the glasses when they are stored they are shipped to the shops and supermarkets this is the journey of the honey i hope you enjoy it
there is no doubt that choosing a country is essential thing for students in order to decide in which university they want to study so first they should consider the safety of the country and the education equality
there is no doubt that the students who want study abroad would face many difficulties
students have many other options in order to learn about the local country and the local culture in my opinion they can go and participate in social events and
what wins you the most is playing baito games
i 'm most similar to my father i have not only in a physical way but in an intellectual way we have similar ways of thought of think and
the cities i like the most are london paris and here in spain i would like to live in madrid or in barcelona i do n't care but
and i think that a school and college should make time in the school to practice some exercises and to promote a more fitness lifestyle because it can help to fight both physical and mental health and at the same time the disadvantage of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as a study time or learning some other things and
honey is collected from base
i think that when a student is choosing a country to go to study there the first thing that they are thinking about is about the university quality and
i think that the best thing of studying in a second language is that you can put in your resume and at the same time it is a very valuable thing from that enterprises value
i think that there are a lot of constraints when you are studying in another country first of all you have to learn a new language and talk in a new language or in your second language and
i think that our students can learn from local curators going with their classmates and learning from them asking them
in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything at your own for example you have to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you do n't do when you live alone
is to hold in winter and to hot in summer
on a holiday i like to enjoy my time because it 's a break i like to travel go to the beach and sometimes i stay at home and watch movies
i like to spend time with all my family with my brothers with my sister my father my parents and i talk with my cousins
in the future i would like to work in a company called johnson and johnson and i would like the position of the engineer senior in the area of the developed new products
in my opinion it 's a good idea that students can get a job to pay their students but it has to have a job of half time because you have to get a balance between your students and your job one of the advantages is that you can get experience because a lot of students get graduate but they have no idea about how is the liberal world in my opinion is one of the best things that one student can do when they are a student yet
the next picture shows the stages people need to when they go to travel by airplane first of all you have to get the airport and make your check in after that you have to go to different control and
technology offers us a lot of tools to improve or a way to learn one of them is that we can look for all the information using internet and also we can look for examples and videos
fix the face is the best way to learn because you can look at your professor and you can concentrate best in this way you have no disorders
the group projects give us the opportunity to learn to work in teams to use all the abilities of each one of the members in a team
attending lectures by yourself in my opinion is best because you can pause when you need instead when you are attending lectures with other people you can not do that
for example in my own experience i learned best when i am listening
it 's one hour to barcelona an hour to the beach it 's a nice place
in holiday i enjoy staying with friends and going to the mountains sometimes to the beach
in my second close family maybe with my brother in law
i am not sure but one possibility of job as a teacher is one of my favorite jobs now
okay that one advantage is that while you are working you are learning what is life and at the same time you are studying of course and this advantage is that maybe you are too much busy working and sitting at the same time then you can turn a little stress and this is a good thing for the healthy and in my opinion i think that is a good idea to do the both things at the same time working and studying because working you can learn a lot of things that you can learn and studying you can learn things that you can learn while working
for traveling by airplane first you must arrive to the airport by car by train or by coach then when you are here you must check in after checking you must pass the document control where you need your passport after after the security control you must wait for the boarding moment then while you can take some lunch or coffee when you are borrowing after you board you can fly to your destination
i think that the technology can improve the study because you can find faster in the information and at the same time you can stay in connection with other people
me too i think the same i think that face to face you are more interested with the person with them
with group projects the people can improve the past the patterns the be quiet listening and thinking more deep and the communication more efficient
in my case i think that it 's better running alone because i prefer the silence and the quietness and the calm
it 's important because not all the people have the possibility to have all the facilities
that really matters to me to inform myself about what is happening in the world i think that 's really important to be aware of yeah what 's happening around to me so i really enjoy listening to radio in the morning
what i preferred when i was a child was playing with little cars and imagine a kind of city with homes buildings schools and i was a creative kid i think
highway hope to travel the opportunity to live abroad because i think it 's an incredible human experience for instance i 'd like to go to america on the west coast in a city like san francisco and just enjoying
actually i do n't see a lot of disadvantages out there not drawbacks in
but satune 's net it was the worst at the first day and after five days we can observe like an incredible increase of the visits on the website comparing to the yellow site with totally haphazide it just fed up
they are able to understand their needs and their problem they communicate a lot with their peers
i think the main issue is that you have so much work to do everything plus i think i 'm deeply convinced that having a small team can create anxiety and problems
you just have to really really communicate explain you do
you play convinced that you can do a better work if you share your opinion and your ideas with co workers but i 'm not sure that people working alone are bad at work
because i enjoy travelling so the best way to enjoy travelling is knowing about the other cultures so
i enjoy hiking reading studying spending time with my family well my free time i try to enjoy a lot so a lot of hobbies i have and work out
obviously the best way to improve my english is traveling abroad to countries with speak english but it 's impossible to travel the whole year so it 's time
i am going to speak about if all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying which are the main advantages the main advantage is obviously they can get money to pay their studies a part time job gives more independence and allows to be in contact with real jobs however one of the disadvantages is that they have less free time to study
the pollution causes by factories and vehicles rise to the air and are carried by winds these
the advice i could give is to eat mostly fruits and fresh vegetables and give up fast food and fast food that can damage our health
i think it 's better to sleep eight hours however sometimes it 's impossible to do it because our bcstal life does n't allow us to sleep eight hours
the energy can have a positive or negative effect
i am very interested in learning about other countries but personally i did a study abroad in ireland and i met a lot of people from different countries especially from spain and holland and germany so i am very interested in learning from the cultures
i enjoy spending my free time with my family watching movies or series also by making exercise with them hiking or walking around the house
the best way to improve my english is by watching movies or series also by reading books and normals so that i can learn my skills in english
i think i will learn to read more and read faster because i 'm not a faster reading so i would like to learn that to read more books and to learn more about the cultures of the world
good afternoon today we 're going to talk about if the university students should do a part time job while they are studying some of the advantages of having a part time job while studying is that the students gain the responsibility of their actions also they gain the skill of organizing more their time and also the skill of working in teams and cooperate with each other a disadvantage is that they have no much time to study so an effect is that the grades decline and they can and sleeping class but in my own opinion i think it 's a good way of the students to learn teamwork and organize skills in their life
good afternoon today we 're going to talk about how the acid brain is created first the initial factors are the factories and vehicles they create pollution to the air and this pollution creates the acid particles in smoke this is carried by the wind and some of these particles fall into us and some of these particles stay in the clouds these particles are the ones that damage the environment so that is why we need to change the factors vehicles and factories to decline as it rains
first of all they need to delete every candy they have in their house so that they can eat and start eating good food and to have healthy life like fruits and vegetables and start doing a mini
i consider that drinking water is a good form of starting a healthy lifestyle drinking two liters per day is a good amount of water to be hydrated and to be happy in your day
doing exercise is a good way of starting a healthy living and you can do exercise three or four times a week not inexpensive like every day but
i consider that eight hours sleeping in the night is a good way of starting a healthy lifestyle
i can see their technology has impact in a bad form to the healthy lifestyle because many people are now watching their cell phones all the time instead of going outside and doing exercise and
well i 'm into it
well i do n't have much free time but i sometimes walk around the city go sightseeing or just visit museums and i adore watching movies films and series
well i think with diving into the context of english language i mean watching series and films really helps me improve my language
well i would like to take up sport classes and i think like this discipline really would help me
this is an opinion that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying so there are some obvious advantages to this opinion first of all they would get better in financial literacy they would know how to deal with money they earn and they would become more independent from their parents as a great advantage to this thing and i think it could be crucial for them and
so i 'm gon na give a presentation about acid rain and how it affects the environment so it basically starts with bi vehicles and factories releasing emissions into the environment and it all comes in smoke and acid particles that are in this smoke are being carried by the wind and releasing into the clouds or just fall as dust on the ground these particles that are mixed with the cloud they settle to the ground and forests with rain and snow and these forests are suffering from acid rain
i would recommend these people to listen to their gut feelings tell them because they would know what food they really want and not their brain but their body wants to eat
it is essential to drink lots of water on daily basis because our body consists of water on eighty percent and it just would really start their metabolism to work better
i agree with the opinion that sleeping around eight hours a day is a key habit because if you do n't sleep enough you would be tired and wo n't be productive at all
it 's quite a questionable opinion because technology truly helps people to make their lives easier but not always they can harm health too i guess
it 's paella and it 's a wonderful rice a non important point is the language spanish
on holidays i enjoy going with my family to the beach or with my friends to play football handball or another sport because it 's an incredible wonderful place to play with your friends and i also play video games with my brother it 's wonderful
i personally think that i spend more time with my brother because my hair is always working and this is terrible because if they are working all day i can see every day and this is a hard work problem
in the future if i have the possibility i want to do nursing to help people or a policeman because they can help people and it 's wonderful and impressive to help people and gain money
students should get jobs to pay for the university studies from a point of view because the advantages of this are that you are prepared for the future and you can get money but the disadvantages of this situation are that if they would prefer to play video games or another thing they can not do it because they have to do these jobs but in my opinion i personally think that it 's better to do a part job not a totally job that 's complete all day because i think that university is to enjoy your life and then to prepare for your future and work and get money for your family because it 's essential
what you have to do for traveling by airplane first you have to travel to the airport then we have to check our documents in the document control with policemen it is essential that all the documents will be correct because if it is not correct you can not go by airplane and and then you can wait in a restaurant or go to the toilet it is essential to go to the toilet because in the airplane it is difficult than other sites then you have to board the airplane and prepare it for the plane because many people complain that have problems on their airplanes and
from my point of view students ca n't study more efficiently with technology because they can use google by computer because they can find more information than in a library and this is essential for a student
and this is a problem
and this is essential for the future because nowadays companies are working in groups and this is essential for your future
and this is better than reading alone that is boring
and this is difficult in other countries
i 'm very interested now about other countries but i 'm in love with barcelona and i 'm in love with catalonia and spain too
i have a shift work so i think enough time to have free time but i enjoy it meeting with my friends and drink some beers for example during the evenings
i think that the best way to improve my english is watching films in original version for example in english and to meet some new people that are native speakers of english and yeah
i 'm going to talk about university students if they should do bad times while they are studying i think that one of the advantages that they have if they are studying and they work into is that they earn money to spend it in in their free time but maybe the disadvantage is that they do n't have enough time to study for example during a week that they have an exam but in my opinion is very important to work in a file of your own study to earn experience and practice
i am going to talk about how the pollution caused rain the pollution of factories and vehicles up with the smoke forming acid particles then these acid particles that carry by wine can do two things it can be mix it with closed water or fall as dust if they mix with closed water then when the clouds collide fall with the rain or the snow causing damage to the environment and causing damage to the people that are in the ground
i think that it 's very important to have habits in your eating for example you have to have a schedule what are you with the eating in the evening or in the morning i think that is very important
it is known that we are practically eighty percent of water in our body so it 's very important to drink so much water in our day day and doing all the whole day
i think that it 's not necessary to do exercise every day during the week but it is important to do an exercise for half a good healthy so as less two or three days a week is important
i think that it 's important to sleep as less six or seven hours but i think that it 's not necessary to sleep eight hours
i think that for some people it can be affect negatively but
it 's a beautiful iceland very green well to be honest just in the north it 's very very green we have like two sides the south is it 's more dry but very beautiful as well with a lot of beaches
when i am on holidays i really enjoy being quiet relax it maybe go to the beach and stay there alone you know listen to the sea the waves i 'm trying to be relaxing
well lately i really enjoy spend time with my niece she 's very cute she 's always looking for a place a new game sorry well she 's very nice i love her and i love to spend time with her
i really would like to be it 's what i really want to do
it 's very common that students in the university have a job to pay their fees or their expenses during the course but let 's see the pros and cons first it 's true that when you have a job you have more resources you can pay more things you but by contrary if you spend a lot of time at your job maybe you can assist to your class or be focused in your studies in
the diagram shows the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane in the diagram let 's start you need to arrive at the airport by train or bus or with your own car then you need to check in that following you should pass the document control and security well once you are free you just have to sit down in a cafe or go to the toilets and wait for departure then when you are getting bored just relax and enjoy your flight
nowadays it 's obvious that technologies maybe one of the main research for students they can use it for mainly internet to research anything they need
but i think in my opinion start by your own it 's really good
they can develop social skills communication skills working on team have to share any ideas with other people
yeah absolutely
i 'm really interested because i 'm studying architecture and i always pay attention how can i be respectful with my buildings to the environment so it 's important so
we enjoy going out to the restaurants drinking some good beer and eating some good tasty food
i 'm really similar to my father and it 's not easy to say that but we are really similar we also do the same things in different ways but in the ending we are really similar so
i would like to live near to the desert i do n't know why but how much i studied architecture i more like the buildings and houses built in the desert i really love the desert
i think it 's really important for everyone to do some exercise along the week but the bad thing is that in our everyday time we do n't have a lot of time for exercise we are really bossy so have some time in our school or colleges to do some fitness is really good for everyone and it will help to keep our health in good situation so it 's really good for everyone the bad thing is that you have to go to the college with extra clothes to change when you finish your fitness classes but
i 'm really glad that this question is from hony because i 'm working on hony and i know really well how hony is made first of all you have a bee because in the nature and bee sees a flower he goes to the flower and takes the nectar from the flower he keeps the nectar to the house the bee makes from the nectar honey then the beekeeper goes to the bee hive and takes all the honey then they put the honey into the jar the jar goes straight to the shop and then you go to your local shop and
in first place language if they want to learn italian they have to choose country where the local people speaks that language so
if you study in another language that is not yours it becomes easier for you to learn that language faster so it 's a really good thing for you to learn a new language
first of all if you never had studied in another place where you were head born it would be really difficult if you do n't speak that language of that place so that is one of the things and
it 's easy you have to meet new friends from the place that are you studying then you meet local people they teach you and show you what they are supposed to do
yeah that is true because you live alone your family is not living in that place so you have to learn to do everything by yourself you have to cook you have to clean your house
it is close to the disneyland it takes twenty minutes to go by bicycle
usually i go shopping with my friends going shopping and talking with my friends reduce my stress so i 'm going shopping it 's good way to spending time on holiday
i often spend time with my mother we often watch movies tvs and get laughing each other
i would like to be a pilot because the pilot is my dream since i was four years old that is a challenging job i know but i would like to be
i think all students should not get jobs but they do part time jobs because there are one advantage and disadvantage advantage advantage is they can know how hard to create money to live and this advantage is their jobs is not working just studying so like doing jobs so it is really hard create the time to study it if they do the job so i think they do the part time jobs
there are six steps to do the travel by airplane i 'm going to explain each step number one we should go to the airport and number two after arriving at the airport we should go to a counter to check in number three the officers check our passport number four and also officers check our luggage if we do not have dangerous items and then number five just wait to board and number six board at the airplane
students should use studying apps during taking a train or buses during train or buses we have some free time so use apps to study effectively
face to face studying style is best i think because teachers can know how students understand the class
i think listening skill is going to be growing up in group projects
i think attending lectures is a better way to study because if we can not understand the class we can ask the teacher to teach me
it 's a really big town
well i really like spending time with my mom because together we can do everything but the thing i really love the most is go shopping with her because we can spend hours and hours they are browsing at the shops and it 's really fun
the job i would like to have is to be a virologist teacher for this reason nowadays i 'm doing like a master to be a teacher in the future
in my opinion for the students i think it 's a really good idea to get a job just to pay for their university studies because i think that getting a job could be a really good way to be more responsible and to know how important it is to get a job and how difficult it is to earn some money on the other hand it 's true that if the students have a job they have less time to go to class or to study
if you want to travel by airplane first thing you have to do is go to the aporp you can travel by car and also you can get a train or maybe a bus then when you arrive at the aporp the first thing you have to do is go to do the shaking then you have to left your luggage and you can take your document ticket then you have to go to the document control and then you have to pass the security control they are going to check your luggage and all your documents and also your ticket to get the airplane then if you have some free time you can wait at the coffees and maybe you can go shopping to the duty free one and
the good thing about the technology to study is that you can check all the things that you maybe wrote in the class and find more and more information about one topic and then you can know more and have more knowledge
i think so i think if you are learning face to face with your teacher you can ask him all the questions you can have
i think it 's a really important thing to work in groups projects sorry because it 's really important to know how do you work with others you have to spend time with other people in the future job and
i think it 's more effective because if you just read alone you do n't speak with other and you can hear the others opinion and i think this is better for our knowledge and also for our study because
i think we are all the same and it 's really important to give learning facilities because maybe some people need this and it 's good for them
i have a deep interest in learning about other countries it 's something that catches my attention and i think that i can learn a lot about it
i can say that i love go running and jogging with my friends and with my children also
to improve my english i think that the best option is to listen and to speak with other people even though it 's hard for me to do it
since i am a child i have wanted to learn to show i would like to make my own clothes
as the first one i can say that working while you are studying you can learn other skills that are impossible to catch up in class in addition to this you can make contact with friends and with other people so you can enrich your university experience on the other hand if you are working at the same time that you are studying you have less time to dedicate to your exams as well as that usually the work schedules are bad and you ca n't find it in
acid particles come from the factories and the vehicles since they are good they are small it is extremely difficult to see it they travel mixed in the fumes so that they end up in our woods as well as in the water and
to start with i would say them that saga is something dangerous that they should avoid in order to improve their health and eating habits
we are in mind that our body almost water is something necessary and avoidable to us drinking water
absolutely however you should remember that doing exercise is not only going to the gym but also you can do exercises while you are doing sopping or cleaning the house for example
how many hours do you need to be sleepy are different from each person to all of us
at this point i have a mixture of feelings and thoughts but i would like to say that although technology is something positive in general people tend to use a badly
as i have said i live in mallorca which is an island i like living there but it could be difficult for those people who are not into it because if you want to go somewhere you need to take a plane and it 's not that easy
because i also like being cold but i prefer doing things which involves the sun
well that 's a difficult question because i love spending time with my family all of them but if i have to choose someone i would choose my brother because we only differ by four years and we have a lot of things to talk about and some things in common that we can compare
when i was little i always wanted to be an astronaut and that 's because i studied physics and nowadays i do n't want to be an astronaut but i do like things that involve the space
i do n't agree with the statement of this question because even though it has some advantages like for example you learn how to earn your own money and i it also has some disadvantages such as do n't having free time because you are spending your time either studying or working but not spending the money that you are earning for example so my opinion is clear in that case i think but also i think that university studies should be free for everyone so everyone has the same opportunities
traveling by airplane is one of the most normal things to do nowadays first of all you need to go to the airport so you can go there maybe using some public transport because otherwise you need to pay for your car to stay there once there you need to do your check in where your luggage would be reviewed and then you need to wait for your flight and go onboard the plane which is usually done by groups finally you take off with your plane and enjoy your trip
they can use technology in a lot of ways is while
well i agree with this statement but in fact with the covid-19 situation i would say that learning online as i have done for my english classes is a good way to
there are a lot of skills that can be learned working on group but i think the most important thing is to learn how to collaborate and listen to the other people because it is important if you want to work with some people just learn to listen
yes i agree with that because if you are reading alone maybe there is something that you do n't really understand but you just keep it while if you are attending a lecture maybe these people who know how to do that can teach you
i think nowadays it is essential because with the new technologies it is really easy for them to make something and create facilities which can help us study more effectively so i think it 's essential and they should do that
when i was a child i enjoyed going to the park to play with my friends obviously my mother come with me and also i remember that at weekends my family and me went to monitain and
so i would like to work in a law office or maybe in a big company my father is a lawyer so it 's easier for me to work in a law office than in a company
that 's an interesting topic and i 'm going to start my fourth year so i 'm doing my period of practical work experience the the principal disadvantage for me at least is that i do n't have enough time thanks for watching
ok this graph shows how much people are visiting the sites during their first week online we can see that there are three music sites tunisnet music now as songs for you they are represented in three colors blue red and yellow and we can see that the majority of people visit music no so it 's the most famous site during the first four days the minority of people visit tunisnet
in my opinion a team leader will be able to listen to the other members of the group group
the main problem probably will be that there are not enough proposal or ideas for doing the job but for me it 's not a problem
in my opinion it 's important that members of the group have a different opinion because in this way they can discuss and debate and probably it will be a better solution
i believe that it 's better that the group are face to face in order to discuss the different solutions but it 's not the most important thing to have a good job
i strongly believe this affirmation because when you work alone maybe you do n't think all the possibilities
i live in a big house it has five rooms each one for my family and i have my room two beds and one bedroom and one closet and
when i 'm in holidays i enjoy going to the beach enjoy my family do things i do n't usually do while i 'm studying or doing busy things so i enjoy being happy and relaxed and also read books
i most enjoy spending time with my mother cuz she teach me how to cook when we talk we are like friends and also she teach me a lot of things that i wo n't learn if i talk with someone else that 's my
in the future i would like to work in a company that gives me an opportunity to develop my career studies like financial management trading or something like that
all students should get a job to pay for their university students most of them fail doing both things so an advantage is that you could get more money and pay your university but the disadvantage is that you do n't get the knowledge that you should n't get if you dedicate all the time to study sometimes it 's hard to work and study at the same time also
what do you need to do if you are going to travel in an airfield first you have to translate or to travel to the airport then you have to go to the officer and take the document control and you have to wait at the cafe or also you can go to the bathroom or just wait to your plane then you have to board their plane and just slide it have a nice flight
students can use technology to study matter effectively in the ways that they can search everything they want in the web that 's why the internet and the cell phones and computers let us be more flexible
i think that learn face to face with a teacher it 's better because we are in a pandemic way and it 's not easy to learn by classes online so i prefer face to face really i understand more than only classes
if you work with a group in a project you can learn how to work in a group you learn how to share your information with other people
well in my opinion i prefer reading alone because i understand more if i do n't understand i read it and repeat it again again again until i understand but in attending lectures if you understand that 's it if you do n't sorry
it 's very important for the universities to provide learning facilities because if the university has a level of learning facilities the students will approach all these facilities so the students are going to be the highest level of students
i 'm really interested in the environment because i think it 's very important if the environment our life is well too however if we do n't take care of them we have a lot of problems with our lives for example
i 'm very similar to my father both are a lot of kind and besides we are very similar we look like we are equal
i could live in the sainte town because i think that my town is fantastic and i do n't like to move off them for this reason
doing exercise is very important to be in fit and for the reason both the schools and college should make a timetable where there was a time to do fitness classes this is very important so the student can have a rest and practice exercise however some students can think that the reason is important and maybe prefer meet friends or spend their time studying or doing anything else
in the first place bees collect nectar from flowers then they make honey from nectar in beehives when the beehives are full bigger beaker pears collect honey and they introduce in jars when they have enough jars they transport them to a supermarket by a car or by a lorry it depends and finally the jar of honey is selling in the supermarket
a student choose another country because they want to learn another language and this way is the best for them
the advantage of studying in a second language is that you can learn another idiom and
when you are part of your country your life your family friends sometimes you can feel alone and this is very important for me
it depends it is n't necessary to go abroad for becoming independent for example you can live with your father or your family in general but you can be independent and do your housework and your food
my favorite time of the year is winter but also spring that is because here in spain summers are very hot and i do n't enjoy them very much i
i think it is very important to be aware of the news because if you want to change something that you do n't like you first have to know that it is happening you do n't know if it is happening you can change it
as a child i used to spend my free time cycling because i really like bikes and also going out with friends playing table games with them on the street and you for watching
in the future i would like to work as a receptionist because i 'm studying judaism and also i would like to go to live to london because i want to improve my english more and more and
although there are a lot of people that think it is not necessary to include a period of practical work experience in the degrees there is a big argument about this on the one hand including a period of practical work experience is positive because you are going to be more prepared to get into the labour market when you are out of the university also you are going to learn about things that are only learned when you are working in a different place from the university for example to have a boss and some things like that on the other hand it is difficult to include a period of practical work in that degree that has a big theoretical part because they are going to take time from them
i think the main problem of working in a small team is that if they have a not very interesting interest sorry in the problem and the thing they are working on it is not going to be finished because
i think that it is necessary to be face to face in order to be effective because this year for example in my degree i have been working in a work team online and it was really difficult to organize all the work and it is better to be face to face
components of the team work are very good and they are hard workers it can be better than being alone but if not maybe it is better to work by yourself
i will say quite a lot because i 'm a person who are very keen on traveling around the world and one of the most aspect that i like is to know more about the other culture and culture
i tried to take it easy honestly after having been working so i 'm mad about making plans at a bit or in the natural environment where i ca n't find my peace and quiet rest
there are many ways to improve my english but subtitle and also to listen to music with the letter brightened down and
i think it could be to learn a third language as for example a friend because it could bring me many opportunities to develop my professional career i 'm so interested in international business and
to get a job while you 're studying could have many pros and cons as everything else you like some primary advantage could be that you can obtain some savings which could be great for paying your tuition fees which are really expensive or even to hang out at the weekend with your friends but so
well let 's explain the process of the acid rain what is represented in the presentation or in the graphs that we have below so it just started in the factories and vehicles which are the main sources of pollution the acid particles produced in the factories are in the smoke that are carried out by the wind some acid particles normally fall as a dust and others are mixed with cloud water so the final result is a snow or rain that contains that acid particle provoking the damage to the environment so that 's one of the main problems that we are having nowadays with the climate change and the global warming
i would recommend to follow a balanced diet with lots of fresh vegetables and fruit and forget about two miracle diets that promise you to lose weight so easy and fast because they are not bringing you anything good so
since things around the world claim that to drink at least two liters of water per day is fundamental to keep you healthy so i totally agree with them i consider to drink water really good for health so yeah i will follow their advice
at least to do some walk or to go run you do n't need to do a bigger exercise but i think it 's fundamental to move a bit throughout the day because
well i do n't know if you need to rest eight hours or less but what i 'm pretty sure about is that you need to rest your due time because you need to have energy to affront your next day home
it totally depends on the way you use that technology it has brought as many benefits obviously as the connection with your family and friends immediately
i 'm so interested in the environment because we are living in a changeable world and it is pretty important to be part of the change and think about the environment for the future generations and to take care of them and our environment
we like to travel to different cities or different countries we like to go to restaurants and we like to have parties at night
i am so similar to my mother people says that her twin is pretty similar i am twenty three years old i have black hair black eyes and i am very thin as she is
i would like to live in italy last year i had the opportunity to travel over there and i fell in love with their customs their traditions the language and the people people are so friendly over there and the places are so pretty
i think one advantage i can find if college should make times the school day for all students to the fitness classes is that they will have a healthy lifestyle with different kind of traditions to improve their healthy lives the one disadvantage i can find is that not all the students like to do sports some others prefer to do art activities or another kind of activities i
good afternoon i 'm going to talk about the process of how honey is produced and to start we can see in the first cycle of bee and flowers it represents that bees collect nectar from flowers after they collect that the bees make honey from nectar in beehives and after that beekeepers collect honey from beehives beekeepers are the people who are in charge to recollect the honey from the beehives and also they are in charge to put the honey into different kind of germs it could be in a glass bottle or in a plastic bottle and after that it can be transport to the supermarket where you are able to acquire
i think they have to consider about the documentation they need like passport or visa or other documents the language they speak the customs their traditions their religion and of course the region where it is
i think the first advantage you have if you are able to study in a second language is that you will have the opportunity to get a better job and of course make yourself understood in that language the second language speaking the most is english
so you have to get used to their traditions and the way they live and of course the currency of their money it 's not the same pounds or euro or dollars it 's
well i think you have to be friendship with people who live there so you can make friends and they can teach you how their culture is and make a good relationship
that is very nice about it
to places i like to visit other countries or other cities and get to know their history and
like
in the future i would love to be an university professor i would like to teach in the area of education possibly regarding inclusion or didactics that would be my my ideal job
some advantages of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies would be that once they graduate they would already have some experience and perhaps even some idea of what field they want to go into however there are some huge disadvantages for instance students might not have enough time to focus on their university studies if they have to be working instead dropout rates might increase a lot because what would be the point of studying if you already have a job that is paying quite well certainly well enough to finance a college education in my opinion students should not get jobs to pay for university studies students should get scholarships or some other alternatives to funding thank you
so now we will give you some very simple steps for you to travel by airplane very first thing you need to do is travel to the airport you can do this by different means of transport such as car or bus or even the subway depending on your available options once you 've arrived to the airport the first thing you need to do is go to check in in checking they will give you some information about your flight they will put your luggage into the cargo and they will give you your boarding pass be sure you 've checked the permitted and forbidden objects before you go through security and
for instance you can take notes faster can record and later listen calmly or you can even use the internet to find more information about any topic you want to learn more about
i think learning with a teacher face to face can be useful for lower levels of learning or young learners people who might have some trouble identifying gaps in their knowledge or self regulating their own learning
for me personally it i can focus much longer if i 'm listening to a person than reading by myself and i also appreciate having the opportunity to ask questions or make comments and then we can all pitch in and have a greater length of knowledge
students spend very long hours in universities
i 'm really interested in learning about other countries for example i really love england i have been there several times and i always try to learn anything new when i go there for example written books i have taken different classes on its culture and i think it 's really interesting
well i do different things for example lately i have taken up into cooking i have been developing my cooking skills and i have learned about different recipes but for example i also love listening to music doing a sport and of course hanging out with friends so that 's more or less my free time
well for me the best way for improving your english is taking part into a community of english learning people and furthermore also in a community of english speaking people so like that you can be in contact with them and you will learn a lot by communicating with other people
well i would really love to learn how to code because i have always loved technology and computers and they have been so amazed by those programs which came only by reading sentences they can code a new app or a new video game and
well i think that taking a job while you 're studying is a really good experience for example some of the advantages will be that you will be able to learn new things which will be useful for your learning experience for example you will learn how to manage yourself how to develop other skills such as dive management and how to organize yourself and how to be responsible for your own ads however you also will have other disadvantages for example you would n't have less time to focus on your studies and so i think it 's really important to be able to know what you can do with your time for example if you know that you are going to need a lot of time for studying you should n't take a job because it will take you a lot of time and it will not make possible for you to focus on your job or your learning at the university so even if it 's a really good experience i think that you should be really sure about what you will do
acid rain generates from biocores and for factories so when they create pollution that pollution gets up to the atmosphere there the acid particles are carried by the wind and end up mixed with other particles of water which will create a cloud that cloud will end up raining over the environment and it will have a lot of defects so for example deforestation it will cause that animals will die and it will cause a lot of environmental problems for example it could make that the terrain is not good for being able to grow things there so it will all not have only a damage to the environment but also to ourselves because we have to remember that we are living up on that environment so the fest that we have on them it will end up affecting also us so yeah
well the best advice that i can give them is to keep track of what they are eating so for example they can take a piece of paper and write down every day everything they take so like that at the end of the week they can compare this and they will be able to see okay in which moments i eat that
well for me it 's really important to drink water we have to remember that we are mainly made up of water so we really should focus on that if we do n't drink enough water we could have somnifes as severe as depression or anxiety so by drinking a lot of water we are helping ourselves to be better
well i think that even if it 's just for a bit we should everyday do exercise but we can also do another type of exercise for example like climbing or moving walking to the job is
well i think it really depends on people so for example some people may need eight hours of more for being able to have enough energy for the whole day while some others will have enough with five or six hours so i think it 's important that we know what we really need and we try to focus on that
that diseases so it is really good because we can keep track of our absences
so i think it would be a good time for spend my free time with them
i think it 's essential to listen and read news because you need to know all the success in the world and the economy and the politics so i think it could be a good idea to know the news
i used to go to my cousin 's house but then i loved to play basketball and go with my brother to play video games and play with other friends
okay one of the advantages of including a practical work experience in the university degrees are you could put all your knowledge in doing different type of activities that will you do in your free time work however i believe one of the disadvantages is people are not focused in the different subject that they have i think it 's a very big problem in my opinion i believe that half a period of practical work experience is very important for students to improve themselves their knowledge and put all they have in doing a well job and have a very short experience for he is fiddle carrie
okay in the graph we can see three lines one red one yellow and one blue in the first line red correspond with we can see in the first days the line is increasing the thousands of people who listen to tunnet and in the end in the seventh day a lot of one hundred thousand people listen to tunesnet however we can see music now is more cost and get the high level during all the week and
i think a very good team leader is a person who has got different skills
working in a small group is very difficult because you do n't agree with the people in your team and you have n't got a lot of ideas for doing the work so i believe that it 's better to work in a big team
i think the contrast of your opinions is very important for doing a well job and
i do n't think so i believe that working in a team i do n't mind if you are working face to face or like but it 's essential to have a different conversation to do our job
so i believe that working working at the end is better than working alone because
now i 'm leaving the united states it 's beautiful and it 's a good experience because i ca n't improve my english here
i like spending time with my friend and traveling
friend and time with my parents and my sister
i 'd like to be an archaeologist
but the disadvantages is that you need to find out the time to study and dedicate for the university studies in my opinion it 's good for you to have a half time job so you ca n't study and work
first if you 're traveling by airplane you need to travel to airport you can go by car by bus or by subway or train when you get to the airport you need to do the check in and then you need to pass for document control and the security you need to wait so while you wait you can go to eat something or you can use the restroom or buy some souvenirs or have a coffee then you can go board in the airplane and then your flight is ready to go
technology can help you with a lot about student and learning
if i start by myself i ca n't focus but the technology helps a lot but
you need to think about someone else what is the team work so i think this is a great skill and you need to learn about being responsible
i think balls are great attending lectures can help you a lot with a lot of subjects but i also like to create alone
universes need to find out ways to make easier for the students to learn or for the students for them to want to do that
the environment is n't a topic that i 'm very interested in
there are plenty of things that me and my friends enjoy doing together for example we like to go for a walk and have some drinks we also love to watch movies and have a great time together
i believe that the person that i am more similar to in my family is my mother in fact we are a little bad tempered but we also can be very kind and lovely with people that we care about
at the moment i do n't really know where i want to leave in the future i do know that i want to be able to travel and discover different countries to make my mind about where i want to leave when i 'll be an adult
schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes in fact there are many advantages about this for example students will be healthier and will have a hobby besides school there are some disadvantages for example they can be more tired and maybe if the facilities are n't modern they wo n't have showers to take a shower after they exercise
i am going to present to you about how honey is produced first of all bees collect nectar from different flowers after that bees make honey from nectar in beehives the keepers collect the honey that 's produced from the bees and fill some pots with that honey after that truck drivers collect those pots to take them to the stores where the pots are stored and are available for customers to buy it this process is a very interesting process and shows us how nature works
there are many elements that students should count on before choosing a country for example they should see what is the rate of the university they 're choosing they also have to list their priorities
studying in a second language gives you many advantages in fact it allows you to meet new people
there are many difficulties of studying in another country in fact you have to adapt to another culture
when students are studying in another country they can learn about local culture by meeting people by going to museums or art conventions and
for sure studying in a new country helps you become independent in fact you need to be organized and
i 'm high interest in learning about other countries because i love to share the difference between cultures i appreciate the historical places the food everything
i love to spend my free time with friends especially during the weekend or in holidays because we have fun together and also with my family
i think the best way is traveling and talking with people from other countries or cities also watching cinema in original version and tv shows breathing is a good method too
i would love to learn how to do gardening i love gardening but i 'm terrible with plants my plants are always like sick and i would love to learn gardening
the main advantage that a part time job while you are a student is that it 's the best way to know how your future will be about the reality of your future work of the profession that you have to choose the weaker point here is that you can realize that you have chosen something that you do n't like it so in my opinion i think it is a really great opportunity to be sure about your choice and about your future because your work life will be long so you need to be sure about it
hello i 'm going to talk about acid rain and or what are the things acid rain causes factories and vehicles create pollution pollution forms acid particles that are in smoke the smoke carry these acid particles by the wind some of these acid particles might be for a dust in water and contaminate this hour water like lakes and the sea
in my opinion eating habits is so important to our health to our mind so i recommend healthy eating habits to feel better
the human body is formed by a high percentage of water so drink water is important to us because we need to be hydrated and we need water for our body
in my opinion it 's important to do exercise at least three days per week if you can do it exercise every way just a little it is more healthier than not do it
i think sleeping well is really important to us because we need to rest so if you can sleep at least eight hours will be great for your body
it 's a good question it 's so important for me to learn in other countries because it 's necessary to learn new language or new culture about the other countries and other cities
in my free time i enjoy to prepare some desserts or making some eggs or biscuits and
it 's a good question let me think there are a lot of skills but i would like to learn about to be a cook professional or something about this
hi everyone i 'm talking about this topic all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying so the first question is what are the advantages my own opinion there are some advantages because university students can earn some money with these jobs but on the other hand there are some disadvantages because these university students do n't learn all things about their degree and
hello everyone this is my presentation this is a diagram about acid rain in this diagram you can see six stages about this the first stage is pollution and this is produced by factories and vehicles then in the second stage the acid particles are in a smoke and then these acid particles are covered by wind in a stage four and five some acid particles fall as dust and the other acid particles mix with cloud water at the end in the sixth stage as a particle are in rain or snow so
in my own opinion i firmly think drinking water it 's so important because it 's good for body and for healthy healthy lifestyle and
in my own opinion it 's not necessary to do an exercise all day of the week
depending on the people because technology for my own opinion it 's so important because you can look for all things in the internet and in a social media there
this is not such a thing as free time i tend to prefer outdoor activities to outdoor activities but i recognize that sitting quietly and reading a book is a great way to spend my free time
secondly i believe that the best way to improve my english is speaking with for mates and writing some articles or
i will just love to learn surfing
the main advantage of doing part time jobs during the graduate would be the practical experience gained it is a noticeable fact that at the university theoretical aspects are stored in in deep but the practical ones are hardly ever worked however another aspect of this job in the time is the time to invest in them it is a time to take away from your social life or from your story time
the smoke or arctic particles are carried by winds but the other ones are mixed with cloud waters
well to half a half a star is really important to drink a lot of water because you both need this water and
yes sure i am sort of agreed with this exercise it is extremely important in a healthy diet or in a healthy lifestyle because it keeps you fit
i 'm interested by culture by the language by the moments are there by the heat the weather
for improve my english i am studying listening the news in english on tv
for example to learn a new skill english language
i can see one advantage and one disadvantage in my opinion there are more advantages than disadvantages the advantage is that or if the students give a part time job you can help to pay the school however if you have a part time there are a little of your time that you can study and finish the studies there will be your first objective at leave
well there are many pollution in the world pollution for the vehicles and the factories that the atmosphere absorbs in this pollution and some particles are very very active some axis particles follow dust and other acid particles mix it with the coldest
yes it 's important sleeping eight hours a day but there are some people with five six hours it 's okay and other people need to nine ten hours but
he 's generally positive because in the hard jobs we
i 'm interested in studying european countries i like their culture and way of life
in my free time i like to read books and play computer games
the best way for me to improve my english is to talk to native speakers and watch english movies in the original vision
perhaps i would study european history
the advantages of working while studying are what you can learn extra money and gain experience the disadvantages are the high workload of a student i think working while studying is good because it makes you more responsible
factories and vehicles pollute the environment acid particles get into the air and are carried by the wind in different directions some particles fall into the dust others mix it with water assets in the clouds mix with rain and snow and fall to the ground this is how forested rivers and fields are polluted and animals die out
i try to eat what i want but at some time avoid fast food such as hamburger and cola
i try to drink more clean water to do this i have a water filter at home
i exercise everyday to strengthen my leg muscles
i try to sleep eight hours and a day but sometimes i can sleep more than six hours
i feel good about other people 's technology because everyone has their own plan for sleeping exercising and eating
i 'm very much interested in the environment because our healthy living depends on the clean environment so i care a lot about the environment i try not to waste or pollute air water or the land
besides i also like to watch a movie with my friends at home or theatre
i 'm not sure but my relatives say that i 'm most similar to my father
i 'd like to settle in the countryside in future i have been craving to build a farmhouse in the countryside i want to spend the rest of my life staying close to the nature
schools and colleges should have daily routine of physical activities for all the students there are numerous benefits of doing regular exercise a student can stay fit both physically and mentally by doing regular exercise it will help him or her to concentrate more on her studies ultimately it will help him or her achieving a better outcome and i do n't see any disadvantages of doing regular exercise unless you are overdoing it in my opinion i suggest that it should be made mandatory for every student to do regular exercise at a particular time
today we will see how honey is produced from the diagram we can see that at the very beginning the nectar produced by flowers is collected by bees in the next stage the nectar is deposited into bee hives and the bees turn nectar into honey honey later the collected honey is poured into jars or containers and the jerk honey is transported to shops or stores for final delivery to consumers
there are many factors a student should consider when he or she decides to study abroad first of all he or she needs to understand that the educational standard in that country is very high
the obvious advantage is that the student learns a different language and he understands how to communicate in the language better and besides he or she can learn about a different culture
the major drawback will be coping with the culture of the country and secondly they might not get help as soon as possible because they will have no relatives in the country
while studying abroad students can learn about the local culture by watching movies at a theater or by going to a concert with friends they also can learn about the local culture by visiting museums
i also agreed that studying abroad helps a student to become independent because when a student studies abroad he or she needs to do many things of his or her own
my favorite activities to spend in my time are going to the gym to train meet with my friends or to watch football in the tv
i think the best form to improve my english is going to a place where the english is the main language like england australia usa because
i would like to be invisible because people ca n't see me when i want to make a joke for example
in my opinion the advantages of two part time jobs for university talents are that these students have more money than the students that the students do n't work and the students have more liberal experience but the disadvantages are that the students have less time to study to do university works
in the diagram you can see the process to generate the acid rain in the first time the pollution is generated from factories and vehicles in the second hand the particles become in smoke later acid particles are carried by wind and it has two steps some acid particles fall as does and other acid particles mix with cloud warrior and
drinking water is an important habit because you need to maintain a hydrated water
doing exercise is very important to maintain the physical condition and it 's essential to maintain a healthy body
asleeping during eight hours is very important to have a great rest because
technology is very useful to help people to improve her health her body but
well i never thought about the environment itself but when i travel to the countryside i do like to appreciate the nature and the trees and animals
there are many things that we enjoy doing together just like playing video games or practicing some sports but i think that our favorite activity is to go to the restaurant and dinner
but when talking about personality i think my personality is more similar to my mother 's
if i have the morning and the opportunity i would like to live in taiwan that is my country home and is a very safe country to live
there are many advantages of implementing fitness classes during this school day since and usually the students do n't have time to practice some sports outside the school since they are busy with their studies the only disadvantage that i see is if you meet the classes obligatory
first and foremost the students should first look at the university 's reputation
there are many difficulties and challenges that students may face when they are studying student abroad just like speaking a language that is not your mother tongue and adapting to a new lifestyle
i think that the best way to know the local culture of the different countries is to visit the tourist places and speaking to the local people
i totally agree with that thinking because when you study abroad you do n't have your parents to support you and to help you
i live in a small city surrounded with a lot of green beaches and
i prefer to go for shopping in the evening and also visiting the beaches in the morning especially swimming it 's wonderful and amazing when it 's a wonderful activity which i prefer to practice in the morning
i prefer to be with my family especially my wife i love her so much we are sitting in this discussion about problem about our future and what would we do to fix our problems and how to solve it in a good way
i did n't want to make any change in my job i just wanted to make my master 's degree in mathematics
and nowadays the fees for the university study has been increased dramatically this is wonderful if you 're doing this the bad thing is the drawback and the detrimental thing is that you may need to focus on your study and instead of doing this you focus focus on maybe work all of the time and my opinion students should make a balance between their work and also their study in university
travelling by airplane is more important and convenient methods to travel from one country to another but first of all you should travel to the airport and try to come on time because if you did n't come on time you will miss your plane and after that you will go for chicken and after chicken document control they examine everything and scan your document after that you will go for security and they do their work in a good way after doing all of this you will wait for your plan and before your plan tick off you will be in the pool and enjoy your plan to another i ca n't tell you
technology is more important in student lives face
when a student is working in a group they learn from each other it 's important to learn more about how you can communicate in a group not in an individual way
i think it 's more important for a student to attend the lecture because they will have everything about the lesson which was studying or
it 's more important for the university to over student modern facilities like laboratory on the internet and searching for information using the internet using the tablet and therefore
my favorite day of the year is summer because in summer i can go to the beach or i can go shopping with my friends or with my family
i think it 's very important to listen or read the news and today thanks to the internet it 's easy to read or listen news
when i was a child i remember i used to play with my brother at home or with my friends in the park and i liked football
in the future i would like to be a teacher for this reason i am studying english in a private academy because i need to pass aisan
this picture shows about bc two three new online pop music site in the picture we can see in red the 2ness net in blue music now and in yellow song for you and the better or more listen listen it is music now and follow songs for you and by last tunisian net
in small things it 's more difficult to learn and
particularly i think it 's better work with teamwork because work with people is more easy
i enjoy drinking with my friend because i like drinking the alcohol and then my friend likes it too much and so i can communicate with each other more smoothly
my mother is the most similar as me firstly my character is assembled to my mother and then my action is assembled to my mother too
therefore i want to live in the center of tokyo
it is seen schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes maybe maybe however it is advantageous because the student enforces that to lack for their fitness and workout time therefore
okay i will give a presentation about how honey is produced and secondly some bees make honey from nectarine in bee hives and then some bees concentrate for the honey suddenly beekeepers collect honey from bee hives and then the beekeepers can drop in the bottle or the honey and then they transport for the store and then
some students should consider choosing a country with more carefree because some countries is endangered for the serious
the student can feel a difficulty of studying in another country because it is possible that there might be a difference in their native country
yes i agree with this opinion because the student can not rely on somebody who can communicate with their mother tongue
my city is a small one it 's built around the castle it has quite some history but i do n't think it 's very fun to live here there 's not much to do
read i like to go to the beach i like to climb mountains and hike this year i 'm going camping and i think it 's going to be a pretty cool experience
so it 's my dog but i think it 's my brother my mother definitely out of the people of everyone it 's my dog his name is fred he 's a cutie
i 'd like to be an astrophysicist
these advantages are that you do n't have much time to study you it 's hard to relax and spend time with your friends in my opinion it depends really she have a lot of money you do n't exactly need a job but if you were you know poor i 'd recommend
you are supposed to get to the airports really early so you can check in with time of course you go to document control and security and check your bags afterwards you wait for as long as it feed it 's needed and then you get on board and you 're ready to fly
there are a bunch of programs on the internet that give you tips on studying or putting in practice your knowledge so you can get ready for tests and now with online schooling it 's even better
i speak from personal experience it is best to learn face to face with a teacher okay you are more concentrated you do n't have distractions popping up in your feed you 're not constantly on youtube or watching memes on reddit i do n't know it 's better face to face
patience you can learn how to make tea with prop with calming properties you will need it believe me teamwork i guess yeah patience a lot of patience
i do n't know if you have good self control you can do things alone if and it 's more effective for some people for others it is n't
so the more modern things are the better
i would like to study english in other countries because i think that is essential to improve the language
i like watching to be with my girlfriend or playing football with my friends i enjoy with good company
to travel to travel is a best way to learn english because it 's the only way to improve a language
i would like learning chinese or other languages like japanese russian or italian for example
i think that students should work in part time jobs if they can actually it 's necessary to work to study because there are a hard situation what are the advantages the money and freedom what are the disadvantages they have less time to study
factories and bacals result pollution that acid particles are in smoke and acid particles are carried by wind in this specific case some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mixed with cloth water and as a result acid particles are in drain or is now damaged to environment
i think that eating habits is essential it 's very important to have a good healthy
doctors say that drinking water is very important for healthy in anything part of the day drinking water is the best option
i think that five or six hours for a night is okay but there are people that need a sleeping eight hours
the place which i live is safe small and quite enough it 's a small paradise you can feel that you live in a small community
i really enjoy doing many things like swimming all day long walking going out for a drink with my friends and of course having fun
when i was much younger i was n't really sure what i want to do in the future but now i am a tutor in a primary school i really love this job
some of the advantages are that they have more money to buy what they need they have more freedom from the expenditures from their parents are less because decent fundages like they may do not have enough time to stay focused and concentrated on their studies at university my opinion is that it depends on their personal opinion
this is a presentation about traveling by airplane first of all you have to travel to the airport using your your car the bus from bus station when you will leave at the airport and you have to give your personal i d or passport at the security for document control then the security will see if your i d or passport are correct then you should wait about some time until you 're aboard to the airplane and that 's all
nowadays many students use the technology as an effective way of studying and learning the technology is too useful to find any information that they need
to be honest i believe that a face to face is the most useful and successful way of studying and learning as
for me the attending lectures are more effective of studying and learning and this is because you can learn from a teacher who gives you directions to the road to success
for me more learning facilities at the university are so important because they give the opportunity to students to learn more effectively
i love learning about the country because i 'm interested in the culture in the knowledge of the people other countries other villas i 'm interested
normally in my free time i do the sport for example i play tennis i 'm working i do yoga too because i love yoga and therefore i
maybe i think that in my opinion i need an academy because i need a teacher and a study every day because it 's very important for me to do home or housework every day and read
i think that i will learn japanese for example because i think that maybe it 's the language of the future and i think that it 's interesting too
nowadays i think that the students need to work in our partangels because they do n't have a lot of money to pay this study i think that if they work in our partangels and have money for paid research study and in my opinion i think that these are more advantageous and less disadvantageous
well in this graph you can see how the factory and vehicle cause pollution factories and vehicles so this particle causes rain and this cycle can be called chaos diamonds to environment i think that is very important that you help to the environment
are very important if you will have healthy because
in my opinion i think that drinking water is very important because all people need to drink a lot of water every day this is important for your health and you do n't have illness
i think that it 's very important to sleep maybe not all but at least seven or six or nine because it 's very important for you to have a good day
i think that technology causes a positive effect in the people but if you use the technology i love maybe do n't cause a positive effect if
i 'm interested in learning about the uk because i 've been in uk for two years ago to say english
i enjoy my free time listening music do some exercises and go out with friends
the best way to improve my english is have a conversation or speak with my friends because speaking is speaking has the many skills listening and speaking
if i could learn a new skill it would be italian speaking skill because i have many friends in italy so that i want to speak with them
so the advantages that you can from the part time job while you are studying is that you can get money so that you can use what do you want as you like and this other advantages is that maybe there is some possibility you do n't want to study you lose motivation and my opinion is you should do some part time jobs because i 've been doing it and i could get money and could spend money
so the first one the factories and the vehicles has released many positions and secondly the excess particles are in smoke from the position it 's going to the air and third acids particles are carried by wind and fourth as the acid particles mix with cloud water and finally acid particles are in rain or snow and they cause some damages to environment
i can otherwise tell you that you should have to think about the pfc balance you can get the protein and the fat and the carbonate
in my opinion doing exercise is not necessary for every day but we should do it for five days per week because doing some exercise is very good for our health
yeah i think also the majority of people should get eight hours to sleep but someone only needs to three hours or something so
i think technology has very good side but for health i think it 's not good because day before you sleep you should n't look at the smartphone because it causes by blue light
i love learning about two countries
i usually read book and play computer games
i think speaking is the best way to improve my english
i want to learn playing the piano
i think doing part time jobs while we are studying is necessary you can have some money you can spend your time to better the disadvantages is you will be tired
while the factories were doing materials they are making pollution the acid particles are in smoke and then they carrying the air by wind while they were going on the air some particles fall as dust other acid particles are mixing with clode water and the acid particles are going to snow or rain that acid rain is damaging to environments
i think we eat healthy food we should eat vegetables or furious and we should n't eat fast foods
i think water is so important and we should drink eight or ten glass water every day
i think we should do exercises at home or we can go for a walk at the park
i think sleeping is very important too and i agree to the people we should sleep above eight hours
i think technology is a negative effect to people and we should use technology very much
i 'm very interested about learning other country especially i 'm very interested in historical things and events and persons
i like reading especially historical reading books and my favorite book and so i spent my free time going to the library and looking for my books and reading
i believe i need to have a chance to speak english because in my division all persons are japanese and so i do n't in touch with english in my work and
i want to improve my knowledge for control engineering because my major is control engineering and i wish to get a phd degree on these areas and
i totally agree with the opinion that all university students should do part time jobs i believe that it 's a positive thing for students and to the part time jobs because they can get work experience and earn money to buy something for studies on the other hand there are some negative aspects first it 's a fact that they lose time for study the duty of a student is to study and so it 's very much demerit in conclusion i think all university students should do part time jobs
i would like to talk about how pollution causes acid rain please take a look at this diagram and after that acid particles in smoke moving up to the sky and acid particles are carried by wind and some fall as dust the others mix with cloud water eventually acid particles are in rain or snow and falling down to ground and damage to environment
i believe drinking a lot of water is very important especially in salmon it is high temperature at salmon and our body mainly consists of water and
i totally agree with the statement
i totally agree with the opinion that everyone needs at least eight hours of sleep every day because in my case actually i spent six hours of sleeping every day
in my opinion generally technology has a positive impact for people because we can easily get information by using internet and
i enjoy spending my free time dancing mexican culture dances this is what i do it every weekend and i love it
the best way to improve my english is watching some serious or listening music i do it every day and sometimes i call to my friends and we start to talk in english
i would want to learn to working because i 'm really impatient so i need to work on that and make that other people do their work
well i think that students doing part time jobs have some advantages some disadvantages of doing that is that they have less time for themselves and it 's a really hard life to have because the time is n't enough in my own opinion i think that this is a good way to start in the business area
okay first big industries make pollution and the acid particulates travel with the smoke then the acid particulates are carried by the wind and some of these fall as dust other of the particulates mix with the cloud and when it rains or snows this felt like acid particles in the environment and this could be phoodical to all people
drinking water is really important for people because this way you can stay healthy and you can refresh your brain and the part of that this make you functional
yeah doing the exercise everyday is really important because this way you can stay stable and this mix it with some good eating habits you could be fit and reduce some grays
yeah sleeping at least eight hours is good because this way your body can rest during ten hours
well actually technology has a positive point in the life of the people because people staying in homes could start doing some exercise
i 'm very keen on learning about other cultures because for me it is interesting to see how other people from different parts of the world live and the way they live is very interesting for me and i can find out more interesting and useful things to learn for example it 's very interesting for me
in my free time i enjoy going for a run in the forest or in the park where i can get fresh air and meet interesting animals or plants and i also play tennis with my best friends in the sports hall and another thing i travel a lot in my spare time
the best way to improve my english is to go abroad where i can meet a lot of native speakers and they can help me improve my english and the same way i can get a lot of information from the culture where the language is spoken and the way people live in the country
if i want to improve my skills i will choose communication skills because it 's very important nowadays to communicate effectively for example if you have a problem you need to explain it properly to people to make them understand your problem
it is very important to do part time jobs while you are studying if you do n't have enough time of course and the advantage of this is that you can get a lot of experience at work and see how it works with working in teams for example and you can also achieve goals in many areas such as sharing ideas with others and get feedback from experienced workers and the disadvantage at this is that you have got a lot of tasks for university studies and for this you need a lot of time so in this situation part time jobs would n't be suitable and in my opinion many students should try it because it is very useful
well first of all factories produce products and while they are producing them they also produce dangerous elements which go up to the air and it causes a lot of pollution and then the next step is that acid particles are in smoke and the next stage is acid particles are carried by wind and then wind carry them in the air to other places and the fourth stage is that some acid particles fall as dust five other acid particles mix with cloud water the next step is acid particles are in rain or snow and the other problems with pollution are caused by vehicles many transports are used by many factories and other companies and then we should reduce the transport
well first of all they should eat more fruit and vegetables as they contain a lot of vitamins which can improve the health and in the morning people can have cereals as breakfast and they should drink a lot of juice as well
it 's very important to drink lots of water because our body needs it to stay alive and to be more active our bodies need a lot of water and we should drink it as it 's life
and everyone needs exercises to be more active and physically develop
i think that everyone needs at least eight hours a day sleep because our brain needs the rest after busy days and
generally speaking in my opinion technology has a positive impact on our life because nowadays we can easily get information from the internet for example or from other resources as well and we can save our lives
well actually i enjoy watching tv and sometimes i go out with my friends to play soccer and i play the guitar and yeah that 's it
well i think with my sister because she is just kind of my age and we 've got the same testis
well i think that vengeance could be that the students could earn their own money and so they could buy anything that they need and then they get stressed because they are working and studying at the same time well in my opinion the students yeah could be working and studying at the same time because you can get money
well first of all you have to get any way of transport for example you get on the bus then it will take you at the airport and you have to check in then it will be document control and the security maybe stopped you for find out about you and something like this then you have to wait for a moment and then the playing would be bored and
i think the students use the internet because on the internet there is all and they can investigate about any topic and they can learn about all
yeah i think so because having a teacher with you is the very way to learn any topic because you have a teacher who helps you about any questions that you have
well i think they could do your homework faster and make friends and get along well
it 's very important because the university should have the various learning facilities of matures because the university is the most level school i think so
i have a son and i like to spend my time with him and with my husband and also i like to spend time with my friends or i have a small learning countryside and i like to work in my garden
the best way i think that will be with a teacher or if i will have the opportunity to go abroad because you have the opportunity to practice with the people
and there are a lot of people that know these languages and
i believe that it 's important that all the students spend some time in a time job while they 're at a student because when you are working you learn different things that you are studying you learn how is the real life and the response and say you have the opportunity to be responsible with your work and this is important for your future you can learn about something that is involved in your studies and with this work you can get other knowledges different that you are learning in your class
i 'm going to explain to you how we produce the acid rain as we can see in this picture we have a lot of fabrics and factories and vehicles that produce a solution in and then these particles down to all rain forest like rain or snow and because of this damage our environment so also some of these acid particles fall as that and i think it 's important to reduce this pollution to avoid problems like that
i will tell these people that should eat more vegetables or fruits than other foods like fast food or something like that because these foods are better than the other ones
in my opinion i think it 's important to do exercise not only eat good food or drink enough water because same
i think that the technology is not positive for your health because the ways that it 's producing are not good for the people and is not good for the people
so my hometown is very international city
all the days i usually go abroad to travel i like traveling all over the world and enjoy a lot of culture there for example local foods and talking with local people
i spend my time with my dog he likes me very much so i always do i always walk with him and often play with him
pilots go all over the world so
the advantage is if students pay the university 's studies students can choose everything if the parents pay for it students have to follow the educational policy next the disadvantage of this topic is if students work very hard they do n't have enough time to concentrate on their study it prevents them from doing deep learning so in my opinion the most important thing is for students is study so students have to concentrate on their studies and get skills that help their future then they can get a lot of money
i 'd like to talk about how to travel by using airplane first you have to go to the airport by using cars trains and bus when you arrive at the airport first you have to go to check in counter then you have to do check in then you can get boarding pass next you have to go to document control there your passport and some documents will be checked then you have to go to security in the security area your baggage and your luggage and also your body are checked for safety then after finishing it you can wait in the airport you can go to the cafeteria restaurant and so on
so by using that you do n't need to actually hire somebody to teach them what they do n't know you can just use the internet to find out what they need
if it 's not face to face that 's a little bit harder
okay by group projects gain cooperation and also by doing group projects you can get your own parts so you have your own responsibilities to finish whatever you need for the project
my attending lectures are more affected by reading alone because there is a part that of you want to go in to see and somebody is actually talking to you is better than you just reading from a book that somebody wrote
i think it 's very important for universities to give modern facilities because students that are going to university would need it and if it does n't have that kind of modern facilities well there 's not much meaning of going to university at all
i enjoy spending my free time with my friend playing the catch ball with my friend in the park nearby and exercise it 's very good for good health
i think i similar to my mother because it 's because my mother i like talking too so it is very similar she is very nice woman
i would like to talk about schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to the fitness classes first about advantages i think it is exercise doing it is very important for them to exercise because they become healthy so in my opinion i think all students should do fitness classes then be healthy
i 'd like to talk about how honey is produced first bees collect nectar from flowers second bees make honey from nectar in bee hives and third beekeepers collect honey from bee hives then they correct honey on the bottle finally they are carried by car and display merchandise so for incogridium i think it is very delicious honey i think it is nice thank you
i think it is useful to work in the future i have a second language it is very useful for work and new places
i think at the first time they have to speak another country language it is very difficult so they can study english very well every day
i think so too
i enjoy spending my free time watching tv series i think i spend quite a lot watching tv series my favorite tv series is big bang theory
i think the best way is speaking with my sister and with other persons that i can improve my pronunciation and also watch tv series and tv learn new words
i think i would like to learn how to write but write a book or something like that because i think i 'm the worst in writing
i think students should do part time jobs because some advantages are that you can create new skills you can have more experience and also you can create new relationships or for your work or maybe for your personal life and some disadvantages are that maybe like a student you do n't have a lot of time and if you have a job and also you need to study it 's gon na be difficult and for that you ca n't forget about other relationships like your parents and something like that and i think is the worst idea to lose those relationships because you focus only in your job and only in studying but i think is the best way to have experience in their real work
as we can see in the presentation factories create that pollution are also vehicles and that pollution that create access particles that are informed like smoke and then those particles are in the air because of the vehicles and factories and that create assist particles and mix with cloud water and that water like we can see they is useful for the treat but when that assist particles are in the rain they affect on those plants because they need water and the water is something that in a planet is essential
for example they do n't eat good because they do n't know how to cook or maybe what product they should buy so
i think drinking lots of water is important because our body needs that and
not every day maybe three or five days a week because our body needs to rest and it 's something that a lot of people they have a different opinion because they think they need to exercise every day and
i think we need to sleep like eight hours because our body needs to rest and if we do n't sleep enough it 's going to be difficult for us to have a good day in the next day that we wake up
and also there are some apps that motivate people to do exercise and drink water
i 'm not really sure because every time of the year have good things and bad things but i think i 'd say summer which is the time of the year where i can go to the swimming pool with my friends or to the beach doing more things there 's
well it 's a bad point for my point of view but i see the news while i 'm eating on the tv because i eat with my father but i do n't read the newspaper and i do n't listen to the radio so i 'm not interested in the news
i loved going to the park with my friends which were my friends of the school and also my neighbors because all of us lived like in the same area of the city so ball
i 'd like to maybe be the boss of a big company and maybe work in abroad because i do n't think i 'd be able to work here in spain so i 'd like to work in a big company with international issues maybe exportations or importations
i think practical work experience is really important before graduating but not all the courses should practice it because for example in the first course you are just giving students the first notions of what they are studying so they are not prepared to have the responsibility of doing any practical work experience so from my point of view it 's important but in the last courses like in third or fourth of the degree that they know what should they do if they have a problem in a work experience
okay so in this graph we can see three music sites so the first one is tunesnet tunesnet starting with twenty thousand of people then the music now started high and it 's still high well it has increased but it is under the red line and but
and you not need to be the boss you do n't have to give orders you have to involve with the team and work with them maybe work more than them
but if you are less people you have to do more work per capita so i think by the way it 's good to control but it 's bad because you have to work more
i think it 's very good and very healthy to have different opinions and different point of views because like that we can do a better job and we can share ideas that we all agree but i do n't think it 's really good though
i think it does n't have to be face to face to be in order to be effective i mean you can do an online reunion or whatever but i think it 's better to do it face to face because you can see others ideas more clearly and
i totally agree with that statement because if you 're working in teams another one could have a better idea about what you have n't even think so i think it 's really good to have all the points of view to share your ideas and maybe you 'd be better in other areas
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries and other cultures i think it 's always interesting to know cultures so different from your own
i enjoy spending my free time watching tv series or playing games or reading a book i also like to go to diplomatis with my friends
well in my opinion the best way to improve my english is speaking or practicing or watching series or playing games in english or reading a book in english so practice is the best way to improve my english in my opinion
i would love to learn painting so i could paint my own pictures and hang them in my house and even give them to my friends
i 'm going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of students doing part time jobs while they are studying in my opinion one advantage will be that working at the same time as studying gives you a sense of responsibility about your life because you have to provide yourself for yourself but on the other hand i think that working at the same time that you are studying could be affecting negatively your academic life because maybe you are tired after working to start studying properly so it could affect your grades so in my opinion there are some advantages to this work while you are studying but maybe that disadvantages are worse
i 'm going to give a little talk about acid rain acid rain forms firstly when the pollution emitted from the factories goes into the air in the form of particles that are in the smoke then those particles are carried by the wind some of those particles fall as dust polluting lakes or forests the rest of those particles meets with the cloud water and then forms clouds and when those clouds rain or snow the acid particles goes into the soil polluting our trees and our forest and our lakes
well i think that the advisor will give to people who want to improve their eating habits will be done do not skip any meal and try to replace as much meat as you can with vegetables to try to reduce the meat you eat
i think it 's very important to drink a lot of water you should try to eat at least two liters of water per day and
well maybe not every day but at least three four times a week you should there 's no need to do some heavy exercise you can also just go for a walk or train some light exercise at least try to move every day
i completely agree that we need eight hours of sleep every night the problem is that you ca n't always get them because you maybe have to rise early in the morning to go to work or study so it 's always complicated but definitely you should try to sleep at least eight hours
well honestly i think that technology has had a bad impact in our lifestyle because it makes people more sedentary and they move less eat worse maybe work at home
i will definitely say that my favorite time of year is christmas because everyone is together we have some holidays
when i was seven years old i was a coach potato i enjoyed being in the sofa watching cartoons
as i said before i would love to work as a teacher because i was studying for a year my degree yes for being a teacher and i will love to be the best data ever and
but it was my vocation and
according to the graph related with the three new online pop music side that that they were visiting during their first week online we can see that the music now it was the most popular and on the other hand the tunes net started being the less popular one but it was the most popular during the last one okay
for my personal point of view i think it has to be someone with an open minded who motivated their work and at
one of the most common problems to ring walk teams is the fact that some people are lazy and they avoid to focus on their work so
absolutely i think we have to be open minded in order to work with different people because everyone can have different aspects so we have to listen to everybody and try to change our work until it 's perfect
not necessary currently we are walking in a problematic situation that we have to do in our walk on line i think that with some application we can share our feelings our opinions
i could n't agree more because from a personal point of view i think you can always learn by your partners because they do n't think like you so they can have more creative ideas and
i 'm really keen in environment because in the future if we do n't look after the environment we wo n't have enough water to drink or similar like that
we are an avid fan of the cinema in fact all weekend we usually go to the cinema and
definitely i take after my grandfather in fact all people said that i am his song but
in the future i would like to live in somewhere else but i do n't know exactly but at the moment i choose england i think
i could n't agree more with these sentences because the sport is one of the most important things to feel you healthy and with energy in fact when you 're doing a sport you feel over the moon and you will have more energy to study or doing anything the only disadvantage that i can see in this advice is that you wo n't have more time to learn about other subjects like math and language or history or similar
at the beginning big collect nectar from the flowers in the country after that these bees mayhunis from nectar and mihabis and so big keepers can collect honeye from that place after that they manufacture the honeye and they repart the honeye in different than the customer can buy paying for them
there are lots of advantages but the most important from my point of view is that you will be able to learn other languages and
to learn about the local culture they must meet new people from this country to learn more about their food or relationship and language
i could n't agree more with this advice because you must be independent to live in other countries because you will be alone and you must do all things alone
i 'm interested in other languages and other countries ' cultures
commonly i watched some movies from netflix and i 'm walking near the river and i 'm listening music
i think the best way is speaking to people and read some things and
i want to learn to speak a few languages easily and also i want to learn to play some musical instruments
i think it has some good aspects if you are working at a university you can earn money for yourself and you can be an independent person also you feel so self confident and of course there are some disadvantages you have no much time for entertainment or hanging out with friends and you can feel exhausted
factories and vectors cause pollution and pollution has some acid particles in smoke the acid particles are carried by wind in the sky and it causes some acid rains some of the particles fall as dust in earth some of them mix with cloth water and acid particles are in rain or snow and this circle you
people who want to have health lifestyle eat some vegetables and fruits regularly
in my opinion people should do exercise every day because doing exercise can good for body health
i agree with this view because our bodies are tiring during the day so we need rest our bodies
it can be a change it depends on using people 's using if but
this is my hometown
on my holiday i usually spend my time with my mom and my dad we usually go to the beach and take sun bath and
i think that in my mom she is very lovely and helpful she also gives me some useful advice for my problems and
i 'd like to become a teacher because i love children and i want to have them to broaden their knowledge and i want to have them to gain some social skills to prepare for their future
nowadays many people believe that all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies there are both advantages and disadvantages for this first of all if students get some jobs they can earn their living and also get more money for their study expense and they also can support them for their study free but if they spend most of most of their time on doing for a time job it ca n't affect badly on their study
the diorama batteries the stages people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all they need to go to the airport by any means of transportation they can get such train and after that if they reach to the airport they should go to the check in board and show their passport and something like that in the document control after that they will check their suitcase with the security employee and here
yes i support this idea nowadays even when we study online we ca n't solve some problems especially if your technology is not good enough
of course it is more interesting to attend lectures than to read some documents alone because we can hear the voice and
the place where i live it 's very kind because the people are with very facilities and also the place of a lot of culture and tourist places
when i am in holiday i go out to vacation and go to the beach with my family and also i enjoy reading books about architecture
i enjoy spending time with my brother because he is very funny and also i love to stay with my father but i prefer to stay with my brother because he is very spontaneous
well i do n't really see myself doing the same job as i 'm doing now because i would write i would really like to keep on improving and to keep on promoting and be one of the best architects in mexico
to be honest i think the government needs to pay us for the study because our job is to be prepared to the future and also be prepared to the objectives of the life and all you have to do is take a good job and also do the change in your area where i live so
in my opinion like a student we need to do technology to improve our skills and also to improve our knowledge because
i prefer to work alone but the group projects i know that helps us about to be a leader and also to understand how the other options could be good
i think that the way to everyone learn is very different so i think the learning facilities will be changed because everyone has the manner to learn
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries and cultures
i enjoy spending my free time with my kids with my husband my family and i love also reading books watching series on netflix and eating a good meal with my family
i would love to learn embroidery and i would love to improve my studying skills
we see many university students working part time jobs while they 're studying and i think there are many advantages to that students firstly would have their own income and that would allow them some economic independence from their parents as well as becoming more responsible in their money management the disadvantage though is that if they need to work while attending classes they would have to time manage between their work duties and their university responsibilities in my opinion i think it 's better if the university students do part time work while they are studying but i would advise them to do so during their summer breaks or as they would get the best of both worlds
one of the many problems caused by air pollution it is certainly acid rain in areas where there are many factories and vehicles they can release a lot of pollution into the air that contain acid particles that go open the form of smoke these acid particles are carried by the wind some of them fall as dust but others get mixed with clouds and that can in turn fall as in the shape of rain or snow causing damage to the environment such as crops and water supplies
the first advice i 'll give is start to include your five a day in your diet and another very important step is to cut out junk food and sugary foods from your meals try to stick to three meals a day and healthy snacks in between
experts say we should aim to drink about two liters of water a day it 's very important to keep our bodies hydrated and functioning well like for me anyway if i do n't drink water i get headaches and things like this so
i do n't think it 's essential to do exercise every day i think it 's important to have a regular and consistent routine experts say we should do at least three exercise three days a week and i think that would be a good focus
i would n't say everyone needs eight hours sleep per night i know that i work better if i have between eight or nine hours sleep but i know some people that can not sleep any more than six or seven hours
generally speaking i think a little negative but that 's because we do n't know how to control ourselves and put limits in the amount of time we spend in front of screens be that the phone the tv or computers but if we know how to manage our time i think technology is great
well i 'm really interested in the environment and right now it 's pretty sad to say that the environment is being damaged so i definitely think that we need to take action right now to protect our environment because
we are often doing some sports during the free time so doing this not only can we keep fit but also it can develop our friendship which is i think really great
i think i 'm mostly similar to my dad because we often read books together and we both love writing articles and you
well i 'd like to live in new york in the future because new york is a really multicultural city and in fact i visited new york last year and i was really amazed by this city new york is a great city
some schools and colleges think that they should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes well there are definitely some advantages to do this for example through doing sports not only can students keep fit but also they can learn how to do the teamwork which is very important to their future career however every corner has two sides there are some disadvantages as well for example spending too much time on doing sports may result in poor academic performance so as far as i 'm concerned this is essential for students to learn how to balance schoolwork and sports only in this way can they have a better future
hi everyone today we are going to talk about how honey is made well first of all we collect honey from flowers and then they make honey from net colors it behaves after several days beekeepers collect honey from bee haves and then they will put them into jars and once this procedure is done these jars will be put onto the vehicles and they will be delivered to supermarkets all around the country where you can buy them and take home and enjoy them so this is how honey is made this is how honey comes from flowers to the shop that 's all thank you you
well students need to consider a lot of things to choose a country for example they may consider whether they left the food in those countries whether the weather is great and so on there is a lot to consider
well i think foreign students may find it difficult to make friends or fit in with local students because they grew up in two different cultures and the cultural differences can prevent them from being together
well i think foreign students can ask local students to share something about their unique culture because those local students have lived in this country for many years and they definitely have a deeper understanding about their culture
we are studying abroad can definitely help a student become independence because in a foreign country there is no relatives and you need to solve all the questions on your own it 's really challenging but it can also benefit you a lot
when i am on holidays of course i enjoy swimming to the beach or to the swimming pool for example or going out and visiting the city where i am
normally i enjoy spending time with my brother because we have a similar interest so every day we play together with video games
i to job as an occupational therapist actually i am studying for that but i would like to job as a physiotherapist too it 's one of my dreams so i would like to get
in my opinion i think that it 's normal that students get jobs to pay the university studies because actually the university studies are very expensive the advantage is that you will earn money easily because you are working the disadvantage is that you have n't got a lot of time to prepare your subjects in the university so you have a less time than other and in my opinion i think that it 's normal because university studies are very expensive but it 's very hard to do this
firstly you need to travel to the airport to do the shaking when you are waiting you can drink or eat or go to the toilet and when called you to board at the plane you will take off and go when you want to go
i think that it 's a good option to understand all doubts that you have for example if you do n't understand anything in relation with the unit that you are studying the teacher could help you
i think that attending lectures is a good option to understand things that you do n't know for example if you do n't understand what the teacher has said attending lectures will help you for that
universities want to improve these modern learning facilities because think of that the students could understand more easily all the information
my favorite time of the year is absolutely christmas i really love the atmosphere but also the cold atmosphere the weather like snow also rain i really like rain well i think it 's the best time of the year
i think it 's really important to read news like the local ones newspapers but also in the web on internet
when i was a child i i really liked staying in contact with nature i was always outside outdoor playing ball and i do n't know maybe use the rope
well i would like to become an engineer in particular a biomedical one in study
i completely agree with the fact that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience indeed i think that the main advantage of these include a period of practical work experience consider the fact that probably after this practical work experience students can find a job and also improve their practical ability i think well the main disadvantage of this fact is the fact that probably people think that it 's like a waste of time because they can study while they were working well in my opinion i would like to include a period of practical work during my studies
this graph shows the number of people visiting these three different sites tunesnet music now songs for you during their first week online we can see that in the vertical axis there are the percentage of thousands of people and the days of the week are shown in the horizontal one we can see that from the fifth day to the seventh day tunes net have a climb and there 's a drop for example for the songs for you a slightly drop for music now
i think that the main characteristic of a team leader are ambitions also collaboration and enthusiasm i think that these three are the most important characteristic of team leaders
i think there 's only one problem with a small team well the fact that if a group are small probably there were only a few ideas and this is a disadvantage
i think that the most important thing is the collaboration obviously members ca n't always agree with the sentence of the member but it 's important to come up with a conclusion
yeah i think that it 's very important to create a face to face team rather than an online group i think that face to face team could create more collaboration
i completely agree with this sentence i think that the best results for a group are possible if only they collaborate and they are open minded and they accept others ' ideas because
i always eat dinner or go shopping with my family and we can share it with each other to understand what they are going on
i think it 's my mom i always share my daily life with my mom and she always provides me some suggestions so are very familiar and we
the to and in my opinion i think i agree that the students have the fitness class when they are in the school because they can then be more concentrated in the next class
the honey front flowers are too short the first bit is that bees collect nectar from flowers and bees make honey from nectar in bushes after that the beekeeper collect honey from the bushes and the beekeeper make the honey and put the honey into the jam and after that there is a card on delivery honey to the shop so the shop sell the honey so
i think the language is an important thing if a student wants to learn the english name he or she will choose english speaking country
the advantage of starting in a second language is that or she has more languages communicative skill to communicate with others
and for example for the festival it can be for over local countries so
i totally agree that the students starting a program can be independent because the students need to do everything by themselves
it has river it has a beach the beach is near the town and also the sunset is amazing
when i 'm holiday i enjoy to swimming in the pool and also play music i enjoy improving my skills in my instruments my favorite instruments are guitar and drums and
i play with it i eat with it
well one advantage that i found to get a job to pay the university is that it makes the students more independent so they pay the university they also buy everything they want but one disadvantage is maybe spent more time in their job than in their studies so in my opinion if they have the time to work to get a job to invest time in they can do it but if they do n't have this time it 's better if they just focus on their status
nowadays technology is the most important tool to learn because they ca n't find a lot of information on the internet so
in my experience i think that it is correct because now with the only classes the learning is more difficult and i think the face to face is better
one skill that i consider that all students can develop is the teamwork the teamwork for their jobs is an important skill that they can build
well it depends on each student for example for me it 's more effective to read along because i do n't distract with other things but for other students it 's more effective to read in groups
it 's important but maybe not the most important
in holiday i enjoy with my friends to play tennis to dance and other things that when i study i do n't relax
i think that with my brother he is two years older than me i love to pass time with him
the advantage that students get jobs to pay their university students is certainly that they pay their students but if they work they wo n't have time to study and if they do n't study they wo n't pass their studies in
first people travel to airport with care bus train or other transports or vehicles in the airport first people taking and pass document control or security then people wait in cafeteria or visit stores or the other stops and
in my opinion it 's the learning face to face with the teacher but i think too that it 's important to report with books or share the information on the internet
i think that with attendance lectures the students learn different things that alone do n't stop to learn
it 's important because the world our change and the students need more learning facilities to learn more and different things to the future
like spending time with my great grandmother i really love her i think it 's one of the most valuable persons in my life
in the future i would like to become a classical philology teacher because like showing my knowledge to the students and
in my opinion it 's great that some students want to get jobs to pay for their university studies i think that is a great way to earn experience and earn more money in order to help them pay for their university fees but also on the other hand i think that way if they get job they are wasting time on doing like i 'm going to work when they should be or could be studying and in my opinion like you know if they have enough money to pay for their university fees without traveling their family i think they would n't have to get a job if they do n't want to but if they do n't need the money i think it 's a great idea and
hello today i 'm going to explain you how to travel by airplane first of all you got to travel to the airport then once you are already there you should do the check in after that you go to document control where a guard should check your documents and see everything is clear and in order and valid then and after that you just have to wait and when they tell you to you should board the plane and get ready because the airplane would launch soon
well i think technology is a great way to improve your studying techniques because
i think that human interaction ca n't be changed or replaced by technology so i think face to face interactions with a teacher is the best way to learn right
i think that by working with projects students learn how to cooperate how to share and divide work in order to get something done more fast faster
in my opinion if the person who is giving the lecture is a good speaker i think attending lectures is the best way to get the information right and to understand everything
i think the university should adapt to the way the world is growing and improving students
i am very interested in learning about other countries culture because it 's very interesting for me learning about other things other customs traditions
when i have first time i like watching tv or of videos deep talk or watching series
the method that i use is to practice four skills listening speaking writing and reading these four skills for me are very important to improve my skills in english
actually i want to learn how to play another instrument i actually know how to play the piano and i also sing and i want to learn a new language that is korean i want to travel to south korea
i think that the advantages of doing part time jobs for your students is that you can be prepared for real life and the problems which have a solution to problems some disadvantages is that the students may organize their time very well to study and for the part time job and i think that university students should n't do part time jobs because they need to be concentrated on what they are studying
part two of the war here the first step is to create the first solution then the acid particles are in smoke and they are carried by the wind some of the acid particles fall as dust and they all departed the particles mix with cold water and that is how the rena acid rain is formed and we can find some acid particles in rain and snow
i do n't recommend this that i can give a person is that if or she wants or he can go to an attritionist to give him or her tips for his or her eating habits
well in my opinion it is very important because our body is made up of water in the seventeen percent so that is why i would recommend to drink almost two liters of water a day
well some recommendations or in my point of view doing exercises every day is an option but you can also do twice or three times a week
it is very important in the part of sleeping because when we recharge our batteries or our energies it is very recommended by doctors to sleep almost eight hours
so at summer we usually just bike down to the beach and it 's really sunny here but sometimes it 's a bit windy and it 's blowing really hard the wind is really harsh
i really enjoy spending time with other family members but also to like swim go shopping and eat lots of food i really love tasting other types of food from other countries
i think that 's going to be my sister since both of my parents they are a lot older than us of course i
i do n't know at the moment but i 'm thinking about becoming a doctor but i 'm thinking about it because you know to become a doctor you have to study a lot it 's a lot of math and it 's just really hard so i 'm still thinking about it
if there are many jobs that are available this is a really great opportunity for all the students to get jobs to pay their university student 's studies but some students do also have parents who pay for their university students which is not as good the disadvantage is as i mentioned before if you are working while you are studying at the same time it can affect your grade in a bad way and in my opinion it 's good to get a job to pay for your university studies so that you do n't have to borrow or lend money from your parents or the bank yeah not good to lend money but it 's not good either if you 're failing your tests
so before you 're traveling by airplane of course you have to travel to the airport first so you can choose between car bus or train i recommend taking bus or train because if you 're driving with car to the airport you have to pay for the parking so obviously it 's not worth if you 're paying for a ticket it when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and they will go through document control and security and your baggage and then you can just wait at the airport perhaps go on the toilet eat some food and buy some gifts and when your plane has arrived it 's time to board and then you just wait for your airplane to start flying up to the sky
you can go onto websites to find feedback technology you can write on computers which is much easier than to write on paper but i recommend writing on paper because you will remember the text a lot better
i think exactly the thing say during this pandemic we have been having online classes the whole time and it 's been a lot harder to understand what teachers are talking about when you 're asking questions it 's also a lot harder for them to understand when you guys are not face to face
you know you can take other ideas from others and build your own
sometimes yeah it 's depending on what subject and what it is about but attending lectures is a really good way to study alone because lectures are not available the whole time but you can always study by yourself so if you have a chance do it
according to me it 's really important for the students to have a great modern learning facility for them to concentrate and a facility that works for everyone and that will be silent modern technology for everyone to work
barcelona is so beautiful it 's amazing but based on my opinion i think there is so much pollution and so many people
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy traveling around the world and discovering new places
with my father because we have a lot of common things such as playing computer games
nowadays i work as a waitress but i would like to work as a hospitality management
based on my opinion we have a lot of advantages working and studying at the same time for example you will be more organized you will appreciate your spare time as well and of course earning money is so difficult nowadays you have to appreciate it the disadvantages is the time you will have no time to be with your family or with your friends or doing the things you really love
good morning today i 'm going to explain what you need to do to travel by airplane to get to the airport is not really difficult quite the opposite is simple you need to get there by bus by car or by train once you are there you have to do the check in and leave your big suitcase then you will pass the document control where you have to be ready with your i d and your passport if everything is okay you will go to the security where at the art we check your belongings and then the only you have to do is waiting you can take a coffee you can go shopping you can go to the bathroom take some food and when thirty minutes before you will go to your gate you will go into your plane and the only you have to do is enjoy your journey
i recommend google is a really good app to search different information and to learn new things but just you know how to use it so i suggest searching in different websites
i reckon face to face is much better because based on my opinion that i 'm studying a master online it 's so difficult when i have doubts i have to write an email and wait one day until someone replays to my email
although i consider myself as an individual person i know that working in groups is much better because you have a million ideas you are more efficient you can talk with more people it 's better
based on my opinion i think it 's much better reading alone because for me i hate reading with noises around me or someone who is talking about another thing or different kinds of noises it 's so annoying
the world is changing day to day and we can stay on the path this is the way that we are going to learn new things obviously
a lovely country style cottage
vacation may be around the world
of course my mother my father my brother and younger sister
attend this a doctor a teacher or maybe a firefighter
working while studying can be a great way for you to make a little bit of extra money and while it does have its disadvantage those are usually drastically outweighed by the benefit that it brings that probably why really eighty percent of college students work at time while studying of course it 's not necessary the right decision for everyone and that 's a real risk that if you spend time working and not enough time studying you may not achieve the great that you were aiming for as with most things in life the key to success is to have a healthy parents which is why it 's a good idea to limit your working hours if you do decide to take on a job while studying but we recommend it if you can and here 's why thank you very much for your time
traveling by airplane before you reach to the airport you have to travel to the airport by public transport after and then after that the next process you will be control they have a staff over there to help you to control all the document and then have the security check after you need to wait to the gate and then have some time during the wait time maybe you have go to the washroom and then shopping and then having your lunch dinner after that you will be on board so when the on board time you can depart that 's all
you will be able to concentrate harder on your learning because there will be less distraction than if you were at home
person training provides greater opportunity for group activity and interactive projects individuals who find that learn more working with others will likely want to take as many traditional classes as possible face to face interaction can also provide more networking and opportunity
basic facilities that every school should provide to the students are ventilation and air quality lighting temperature control space and size of classroom
i 'm interested in the environment because for example in my country there is a lot of pollution and
well my friends and me sometime go to the coffee because we are a lot of relaxing and comfortable
and she has glasses with me
in the future i like live in mala this is a big city in the south of andalusia in this city also there are a lot of people and a lot of shopping centers
i think that there is a good idea the sum up bound is the student can be more relaxing and comfortable for the other subject in the school or university
i am exploring to make honey in the first place the best collecting nectar from flower then some best made honey from the nectar in the heap and i want a man or woman what is best to collect a honey from heaven after the woman or woman put the honey in the cup and
i am studying second language this is english because it is necessary for me in the university students
i think that the more difficult of studying another country is who you ca n't see your family but in this country you can be a new friend
well i think that the local culture is very important because you can eat a lot of food in this country and it 's very interesting to know the culture of the local because the people are very happy in this country
i enjoy to learn about the culture of the country it 's something that interests me a lot
i enjoy to watch series in my free time
for me it 's primordial to learn every day at least one word because it will help you to improve your vocabulary that is really important
it would be a better communication because for me it 's really important to everything
the advantage is that the person will have more experience and will create more responsible and will have more protagonist and disadvantage is the time because the person will stay without time to do other things and that can harm the mental health and
hello today i 'll talk about the acid rent let 's go firstly vehicles and factories cause pollution then acid purples are in smoke and acid particles are carried by wind after some acid particles fall as dust and after that other acid particles mix with cold water and finally was it particles are in the room or is known and is just this but it 's that top really important
firstly to want is really essential
it 's important for our body because our body is composted for much water than it 's really important to a good health
for me it 's really important to have a better disposition and a good routine and not die
for me balance is everything to do better things in technology than
that 's a very beautiful city and its culture is very good
in my holiday i prefer to go to the other countries for traveling
i spent most of my time with my mother i love to stay with my mother she is my icon actually
all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies about this topic i think the advantages is that it can promote the independence of the students to live up by themselves but the disadvantages are that students do n't have time to focus on their studies so it may influence the result of their academic performance in
so here are several steps you need to do when you 're traveling by airplane first you can travel to the airport by any transportation you like after arriving in the airport you should check in first and then go through the document control after the security permission you need to wait for the plan to arrive after that you can board in the airplane and then you just wait for the plan to take off
i think students can use computer and to surf on the internet to learn some topics they are interested in that will be very effective
well it depends that will be it
by doing group projects people can learn a lot of new knowledge a new way of thinking from the other students and that 's a very good model for their learning
in my opinion go to the classroom and attending the lectures is more effective than reading alone at home because if you come across some problem you can raise your hand and ask questions immediately
i think it 's very important for a university to provide modern high advanced technology for learning facilities because students can very effectively learn some new knowledge
when i 'm on my holiday i enjoy traveling other countries and do something that i 've never done
the job i would like to have in the future is flexible which i can aim at my pace
if and disadvantages they ca n't concentrate on their future studies so in my opinion they can have it both but they should concentrate on studies than working
i will explain how to process when you travel by airplane to you firstly you should travel to airport by yourself by your car by bus or by tube then you should check in with your flow rate stuff and you should submit your valid passport to document control stuff and also you should be checked by security guard you wait till you bought your airplane and that 's it
well some people say face to face learning is very effective
i think attending lecture is important as much as reading your book by yourself
well providing more than learning facilities from university is not so important for me because you can study anywhere everywhere
well it 's a difficult question to answer because i love christmas and summer but if i have to choose between one of them i would say summer and i feel that for several reasons because when summer i am on vacation so i spend a lot of time on the beach and with my family so
to tell you the truth it 's super important in fact when i wake up in the morning and i go to the office i try to listen to the radio every day and always i try to read different newspapers as well as i try to use twitter for us
well when i was a child i used to go to the beach given that i spent a lot of time with my cousins who were living in another city and with my grandparents let 's say that it was the perfect moment to have all the family close and to spend a lot of time with them
that 's a difficult question to answer i would like to know it but i would like to work in an embassy or consulate i 'm striving to improve my english to get this job i hope everything will work out well for me
to begin with this question i would like to shed light on the fact that everyone should work a little whereas you are a student if we talk about the advantages i would say that you 're going to learn a salary you 're going to learn experience and trust me when i say that this is something crucial if we talk about disadvantages i would say that maybe to spend a lot of time working and for this reason maybe you fail in your degrees to speak well not to fail but maybe you will have less grade as far as i 'm concerned i would say this is an experience that i recommend to everyone it should be mandatory if you are studying a degree because i would say that it 's quite important to get experience in a job
as we can see there is a comparison between different types of people on different days it 's paramount to draw special attention to the fact that tencent 's net began to hit rock bottom however it 's going up but now it 's as the most senior liver however if we speak about music now and songs for you they were at the upside or at the other 's liver however
this is something that is on everyone 's lips but if i had to say something i would say that a person who understands everyone and supports their team you know not as a person who wants to show off or something like that someone who works as a team
well that 's a difficult question to answer because as you know when you are in a small team there are different people and maybe the communication is something good but
yes sure why not but i should say that if it is always in a polite way for example it does n't matter if you disagree on someone because for example that means that you are thinking about how to improve your team
we live in a world that is very competitive and we have technology as a tool for these type of teams to work as a team but i prefer to work face to face it 's more effective
well it 's difficult to answer this question because i should give special attention to the fact that it depends on the person you are or the people who integrate your team for example if you are working with people who are super lazy obviously it 's better to work alone
actually i do consider myself an environmentalist because i care about the sustainability develops of cities
i would love to say we love enjoy time together rhythm for example but the truth is we enjoy hanging out going to bars having drinks and maybe staying at night at home watching movies and
probably the people who i get along the most is my mom because she and i have a lot of things in common we too enjoy having our time together watching movies or tv shows hanging around
i do n't have problems actually living here or there and now i 'm living in amalaga which is a city located by the sea so i would love to live here because of whether there
i do consider one of the advantages of giving free time to students for doing fitness classes will help students to lose their anxiety and lower their levels of stress otherwise what
after collecting them the bees go to the bee hives where they produce the honey after that there are some workers which are specialized on collecting honey from these beehives all the honey collected are put in some yours and then they are to deliver to the supermarkets there actually are different kinds of honey coming from different kinds of species of bees in nature
students actually consider many things as they choose some country for living
studying a second language has a lot of advantages and one of them is letting people to travel and know a different kind of culture and make them independent to live in another place and grow as a person
living in another country and learning and studying there it 's something that only students that are privileged can do that
about the place where i live i can tell you that it 's a comfortable city not small you have plenty of things to do everything is near so you do n't have to do big trips big travels so
while i 'm on holiday i enjoy trying new things new places new food obviously if i 'm visiting a country abroad but if i can enjoy it with friends and good company that would be the key for me if i 'm doing my holidays
i enjoy spending time with every single member of my family but i think i have to say that when i spend time with my sister i really enjoy it just because i do n't have that much time to spend with her usually so yeah i really enjoy it
i do n't know yet i think it 's too early for me to know where i want to be in the future where i want to work at so i have to think of it but i think as long as i have a comfortable job with good people around me that would be a good place to work
talking about advantages and disadvantages of students getting jobs to pay their university studies i should say that as advantages those would be for example they would gain experience and they would learn values such as hard work and discipline in order to accomplish something and talking about on the other hand on disadvantages i think that at those ages they should focus on studying and just be focused on what they want to be and to become what they want to be in the future so in my opinion i do n't think that students should get jobs in order to pay universities because they should be free for me or have a less cost and being everyone capable of getting to a university
in order to travel by plane you have to follow several steps until you finally get into the plane first of all you have to travel to the airport i recommend you to travel by an hour and a half or two hours before you have to travel secondly it 's very important to do the checking once you get to the airport before you pass several controls such as document control or security control once you 've completed all these stages which are very important in the whole process you will have your time to wait until boarding so so after all those steps you just have to board into the plane and enjoy your trip so i would say those are the main steps
i think students can use technology for using other platforms or other options rather than books to study and being connected with people to share knowledge and notes so i think that 's very helpful
i think obviously it 's a better option to learn face to face with a professor or a teacher you get a different perspective it 's more direct form so yeah i think it 's better in so many ways
i think the most important skill that a student can learn from group projects are to hear people listen to people and learn from it obviously other ones are sharing thoughts and respect from your teammates
of course it 's more useful attending lectures you listen to a professional as your teacher and you have the option of listening doubts from other students to interact with them and
i think it 's so important to have good facilities such as a library good places for studying for students they get more involved in they experience the university in another different way
i am very interested in the environment i usually recycle all kinds of products at home in order to get a better world in the future
well years ago when i was younger we used to play football all together but in these days we tend to go for a run
i am extremely similar to my mother not only physically but the personality as well i can understand my mother every
well i really do n't mind i just want to be happy and the place where i am going to live is not important for me but i guess that i would prefer living in spain my country
students are usually fat in these days not only in spain but around the whole world so i think it 's essential to the schools to make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes i can only see advantages in that way maybe one of the disadvantage is the smell after doing fitness classes because there are not showers in the spanish schools so it can be a problem
everybody likes honey but where is it come from well first of all the animal called bee is collecting nectar from flowers after that bees make honey from nectar in bee hives then the professional has to collect honey from bee hives in the more natural way as possible after that honey is almost ready to be eaten
well i think that more knowledge you have or skills you have then more easily you will get a job in the future so it 's crucial to start in a second language
in my humble opinion it wo n't be easy in the beginning but
speaking from my own experience i learned a lot of local culture when i was studying in england and
i could n't agree more with that studying abroad is essential in order to become independent
i enjoy learning about other countries especially about its culture its language its history it 's quite interesting for me
on my wage time i like to do yoga or to tailor i am fascinated in fashion and tailoring
i guess there are a lot of ways to improve my english for example i am studying on speaking them proof and on writing them proof and
honestly i 'm not very good in establishing a report with other people i 'm an introvert and i 'd like to be more extrovert shell i 'd like to have such a skill as small talk
i think that working part time while studying helps us to be more organized to be more autonomous and it also helps us to practice in what are studying i mean that we have an opportunity to experience what are we studying and do something what we studied about and as for disadvantages i think that of course it takes time and you have less time for studying and for your assignments from university and
now i 'd like to tell you about acetylene about reasons about process of its formation and about consequences of acetylene first of all a lot of factors on our planet makes a lot of pollutions then these pollutions with the smoke raise to the air and with the wind it fly to clouds and it compounds with clouds and then it falls with rain or snow into our forests and loans and
well it 's a tricky question but first of all it 's less ready made meal and it 's more home prepared meal and no fast food and junk food
i heard that everybody should drink enough water and i heard the good amount is about two or even three liters of water but as for me i ca n't drink so much water
as for my opinion i think that it 's of vital importance to do exercise every morning or every evening if you want to have a healthy lifestyle
i 'm not sure about eight hours of sleeping but i can agree that it 's very important to have enough sleeping for some people it can be just six or seven hours can be just eight hours
i think it has both positive and negative effects and you should remember about digital hygienic and you should spend less times with your gadgets
i like to travel a lot and no different culture
i 'm trying to attend courses online and reading many english books
it will be how to play it on this
from my opinion it 's good for university students to do part of the time because it gives many advantages to them like acquire new experience make new friends is their they good but another advantage is they learn how to be independent person
the side rain happened when the smoke from factory came up until the sky and other particles mixed after that aside the particles are in rain or snow
for eating the habits it 's prefer to eat three times per day and must be healthy food including vegetables meat and low carbohydrate
drinking a lot of water to keep body hydration and allow you to feel fresh every moment it 's
it is not essential to do exercise every day but at least three times per week the duration for each one must be in our
technology has a positive and a negative effect both for a positive effect it allows them to read a lot of books through the internet and
i 'd like to learn about other countries and their cultures because it 's open a new window a new vision to me
i like to listen to music watch movies design a user interface or just walking
the best way to improve my english is to speak with someone like a native speaker or someone has a skill enough to talk me back
definitely it 's programming or web development
working for students have some advantages and disadvantages some of its advantages is that the work gives them experience in some fields and also it makes them ready to work in the future also all however it has some disadvantages maybe it 's affect on a study because it makes them tired and there is no energy to a study and finally my suggestion is that the university must have some jobs for a student in a relative field that they study
there are lots of reasons that make acid rain but the majority of that come from factories smoke and also vehicles pollution first pollution from factories and vehicles come to the air and acid particles combined in the clothe or some of them fall as a dust after a while clothe make a rain and as it particles are in rain or fall into the trees and ground
i think they have to eat each meals in that specific time and also they have to prevent to eating junky foods and eating healthy food instead of that
humans have to drink at least eight glass of water every day
i think that 's right because if your body ca n't rest and working hour and hour it makes it tired and exhausted for next day
some of technology helps people to get slim and healthy but some of them not
i want to know about other countries i want to learn about their history their customs their cooking and all the things that they do during the day
i enjoy very much my free time reading books learning about other countries learning about other languages for example english cooking and doing watercolors painting

i love to learn languages so i think the most important thing that i want to do is learning english but also in the future i want to learn french and other languages
working during university years can cut both ways many students have the advantage to earn extra money for their personal stuff also can acquire work experiences that will help them in the future but they have to concentrate in their study goals as a first thing to a shift unfortunately some students quit their university after they start working on their money for other students it is impossible to work and study at the same time because of the time consuming for both tasks i believe that it is very personal to each student and his circumstances work and study is the ideal way but no many students can accomplish it
i will give you a short brief about the formation of acid rain first of all as you can see in the diagram the smoke that is expelled from the lot of biocles and also from used companies contaminate the air we breathe this pollution in form of smoke contain acid particles that are traveled by the wind some of these acid particles return to the soil as dust but other acid particles is mixed with the water in the clouds as a result these acid particles return to the earth in the rain or the snow this acid rain damage the environment including soil air water animals human and trees consequently cause many disease to the human

i would like to live in tokyo because my grandparents lived in there and i visit there more than twice a year everywhere and there are people who are grateful and the food is delicious and there are cities every time exciting
i think it is a good idea for school and college to make time since school day for children to do fitness classes because the advantage of it is they can make their body strength and they do the sport and they help themselves each other and make the same goal to each other and the disadvantage of it is sometimes that makes destruction of the body of somebody in my opinion i think it is a good idea in many ways whatever i do i think it is good
first bee collect nectar from flowers next bee makes honey from nectar in beehives after a beekeeper collects honey from beehives the honey is parked in the bottle and transported bought by a car and they are arranged in the supermarket and they sold one ninety five euro for each
when i choose a country to study abroad i really feel it is important to the safety because we have to study english safety it is most important for us
starting in second rank is really important for us to live in these days because we have to communicate with other countries people and we have to do business with other countries people so we need to study
i feel difficult here starting in another country because i live in japan so i could n't meet the english person many times so we have to meet same and speak english online only it is difficult
i 'm really interested in local culture of other countries so when i went to the other countries i would like to go to the local place such as a shop and a restaurant and so on it is good for me
i think becoming inter independent is necessary for us to learn english because if we have japanese friends we could communicate in japanese so we have to defend and run
i enjoy my free time watching the movies staying at home doing houseworks walking around going to the gym and eating healthy food
for me the best way to improve my english is to help someone to correct me and give me basis of advice
advantages are like they or get to know how the people behave through this society and these advantages are that they need to do other things where study they need more time to study and what is my own opinion is that every single student need to put an effort through his or her studies
so there are factories and vehicles that are located mainly in the city and they are very dramatic
the main idea that i can give them is to select the times that they need to eat at least or they should eat five times per day choosing a very quality of food to eat
to drink a lot of water it 's so important for our health so we need to oxygenate our body and at least we should drink like two liters
not every day but we need to do exercise at least three times a half hour per week
sure we need to sleep eight hours per night and rest very good and have a good dreams every night
it 's a positive effect in our lives technology has a positive effect in our lives but is the main thing that we need to live
i extremely interested in learning about another country especially their cultures and beautiful places in that country i also want to learn some of the custom habits and the way people to live and
sometimes i like to enjoy my free time listening to music and reading books
watch english movies every day
much so i want to cook more and more less food for him to enjoy so i think i would learn cooking
nowadays all students or university students do part time jobs while they are studying there are some also these advantages however there are some disadvantages as you know many students they spend a lot of time doing part time jobs so they ca n't finish their courses many of them failed and so it 's very bad for their future when they ca n't get a degree in my opinion students who spend a lot of time doing part time jobs and they are studying because study is more important and they need to spend more time for their study
as the strength is a very serious problem nowadays in many countries and they flies around some of them to fall at this but other still flight and they meet with clouds quarter and then many the article as this particle in the drain as snow when a
they should try to avoid eating snacks and a lot of foods with a lot of oil and red meat is not good for the health the food is more vegetable and fruits
rinking water is very important for our body so and it 's not good for the health they should drink clean water
i think that i completely agree with the idea that people should sleep at least eight hours every night because sleeping is a time for us to relax and release stress also we have time to recharge energy after working very hard
on the road to technology change our lives there are lots of mobility effects on our lives but also have some negative effects on our health
it 's a very nice place where it has a lot of fishermen and it 's just by the sea it 's amazing
well when i 'm on holiday i usually like to visit places where i can you know know about the countries about the culture about the people so i like you know to walk around and visit a lot and i also like to go to the beach and just wandering out and about
i would say the advantages of having a job during the time in uni is that you are being able to earn your own money getting a life experience you know getting to know different people i believe a disadvantage will be you know managing the time between the studies and the time for work and that could be a problem but at the same time that could be a lesson as well you can learn from it so in my opinion i think it 's always a positive experience to get a job during the university time you can always learn something about it and
in first place to travel by airplane you need to get to an airport you can get there by car by bus or you can take the train airplanes get permission to take off and landing by the control tower once you 're at the airport you have to look for the check in to check your ticket and to drop off your luggage from there you go to document control they will check your passport and then you 'll have security that will check your hand luggage then you can sit and wait to be called for boarding
well they can use technology through computers and internet they can research everything they want online and they can use the computer to write everything
i think nowadays that 's been proven wrong we have a situation that we really understand now that if we do courses online they are as good as doing face to face face to face is good but online is also possible
well they can learn how to listen to each other creativity they can be more open minded they can learn how to discuss they
i think when you see someone talking about a subject is more effective because you pay more attention than reading with reading you can go back
it 's very important nowadays students are used to a lot of technology and a lot of apps that do everything for them so if universities or schools do n't have what they have home they will feel very disappointed and
i 'm not interested too much but i think that is quite important because we do n't have other planners to live and the people has n't been aware about the importance of environment i think
well before the situation of covid-19 we like to play football but after this situation we like to play video games and read books
i think that is my mother because i have the same personality that he has and maybe my friends say me that i have the same self appearance that he has
well i think that one of the advantages is that the fact that the student has to do an exercise to be healthy and so and think that it is so important and one of the disadvantages i think that there is no one i think you have to do your workout and be healthy and
well the picture shows a theorem of how the bees collect nectar from the flowers and in the foreground i see a bottle with honey i see to a person with a jacket maybe because if they do n't dress it the bees will sting him and that 's it you
the price of the thing that they will be buy like a laptop food
i think that is quite important because they give you an opportunity to travel around the world for example in my case i can travel with my english to birmingham london i think
i think that maybe the languages because if you do n't know about it it 's quite difficult learning but if you control the languages i think that it will be easier
well that they have a different ways one of them i think that is talk with other people go out there and buy something like that
yeah absolutely i think that if you go far away from your home you have to be independent because if not you maybe can die if you do n't cook it yourself by yourself
yes it 's really beautiful and we have a nice view of mountains and sea and at night it 's windy so it 's nice to stay outside
i 'm on holiday i enjoy staying at home and reading both if the weather is fine i prefer going outside with my friends or family
it has to say that to be honest i enjoy spending my time with my sisters because our age is not very different and i am nineteen years old and she is twenty one years old we are life friends and i can tell her everything i 'm very comfortable
to be an english language teacher it is the aim that i really wanted to be and also i want to do some educational business not only in my country but also in foreign countries
i agree with that from my opinion the advantages of getting jobs to pay for the new university study are that they will be independent in the future and they will get working experience my opinion is really good to get a job but you must be flexible with your job and with your study it is time to concentrate on your work when it 's time to study fully concentrate on i 'll see you in the next one
okay firstly first of all you have to travel to the airport by taking the bus or something whatever transportation that you like you can take and then you have to pass through document controls and also security and finally you will have to wait at and and
on this day because of pandemics we have to stay home it is the best time to make good use of technologies you can study from online and you can also download some educational app and you can do some study
yes i agree that when it is best to teach face to face it 's more effective but on this day unfortunately because of the pandemic we have to stay at home and stay away from online so it 's not very good for some people
and in the future they can work with a lot of people in a company or in something
that 's a good question how can i say for me i prefer reading alone because i can not concentrate well while i am attending lecturers but for some of my friends for them they prefer attending lecturers it depends on the letter
yes it 's important to have learning facilities fully because you know in the world most of the famous universities in the world have good facilities for students and then the students can be learned more effectively
i could n't agree more with environmentalists i am sad fan of rita thumber and i also go to as many demonstrations as i can to show my support to these absolutely fair camps
well it may sound odd but i have no many friends i am devoted to my husband which is the person with whom i spend most of my free time only having nights in and watching the last netflix movie makes me happy i do n't need anything else
well maybe it 's a cliche but my mother is my mirror she is the person who teach me all i know about love about life i love as he loves i am as sympathetic as she is
definitely my choice would be miami usa where i had the opportunity to spend three months as an of the spanish consulate a time in which i fell in love with the city i am here to come back
should business classes be mandatory for every student in schools and colleges what are the advantages of this kind of mission what are the disadvantages and finally what i personally think well when waiting at pros and cons i must recognize that i consider these kinds of initiatives and very useless no one can impose that on us it has to be your choice no one else
the production process of honey is a circle that starts when those little anodine insects called bees collect nectar from flowers ecaipses then honey is bottled and transported to be put on supermarket premises for us could enjoy it or to be able to enjoy it
choosing a country that is english native is a must have because going away has mainly an academic purpose and improving your english is something essential for your following professional career
studying in a second language not only in english if it 's also valid to study in spanish portuguese or french will make the most of your brain and increase your ci to make you more intelligent
becoming independent is a natural consequence of moving away from your parents ' home it does n't matter if you choose to do it within the borders of your country or abroad them the important fact is that you take the decision to fly away
my spare time is mainly reading books and watching tv with my parents and my family concretely
i will obviously learn really really fast as i think this could be really useful and really helpful for me
i would like to say that university standards it 's better that if they have some part time jobs that could be really useful for their future and for their future professional career career as i think that could be an advantage but there are plenty of disadvantages for instance they can be focused on their own degrees or their studies for example so in my opinion i believe that it 's a double h 's word as they have to be really responsible keeping
this jar will show us the cycle of the ash drain that is a demand to the environment so i thought that as rents could be really really hard at the match for all of us people do not do nothing
it 's quite important as your body needs around two or three litres for a bedroid date it
i believe that every day now
i think that depends if you do too much exercise in your everyday life or not but it depends on you and what do you think you do
technology has always been an incredible thing for us like they were gadgets with for instance ipads
i 'm quite interesting on it because it allowed me to enrich my knowledge about other people around the world and it can make me more sage in the future and it provides me an open mind
generally speaking i like going around with my friends and having some work and i also like to drink some beer or coffee while we are talking about our daily life or daily problems it 's quite useful for me
well the better way to improve english is practicing a lot especially when you have the chance to speak out with other people so that you can check if you are understood you know and that 's quite important
i 've always liked to know how to cook because it is very important it 's essential for mika leaving and having notions about how to prepare your own meals so for me it would be vital for my life
well it 's a good thing that students do a part time job while they 're studying because the benefit is that they can save money for their expenses such as food clothes traveling the ticket for commuting and so on but in conclusion from a point of view it 's a good perfect method to start to be financially independent from your parent as well as you have the chance to organize your time to combine work and studying so it 's a good way to become independent of mature
it is obvious that we must end with the pollution in our cities this is because they are producing acid free this is produced is caused with the acid particles in smoke which is carried by the wind and some acid particles fall as dust and others with the clothes water that provokes that acid particles fall down in the ground and that affect to the growing of the greenery and that affects to the human population as well so
well one of the advices would be starting eating fruits and vegetables as much as possible and avoid heavy products with a high amount of sugar that is the main point
yes at least thirty minutes walking can work for you have a better life
yes i think it 's true almost as you need because it 's at some moment where the body recovers from any illnesses or damaging that they have had during the day so it 's quite important
depending on the device because if you have heart attacks there are devices that can detect that problem easily so in medical devices they have improved a lot and it 's very important too
my town is n't small but it has beach river lake and mountain
i enjoy doing nothing
we like jogging and watching documentaries
i would like to work as a teacher
the disadvantage they having less time to study less time to social time or to take away in
the first is traveling to iphone you can travel with taxi car booth or bus when i was arrived you will check in your game then you should be past the document control and check in after you can wait sitting in iphone sets in a restaurant in a bathroom or shopping when you 're eye playing you 're ready you will order
they can use the busy study to take notes or to search on internet
i do n't like to speak face to face because i 'm shy
they can develop their patience and they will help to treat with other people
if people need little facilities they should have them
i have to admit that i 'm interested in the environment and not really really really interested and not really keen on the environment but anyway i try to read as many articles as possible every day on the news to be informed because i think this is an important matter in our current life
we enjoy doing to get different things but one of the things that we do most probably is to go out for a beer or not a couple of beers just to have yeah interesting or normal conversation about certain things serious thing but
i have n't given much thought of that but i 'd say in the future i see myself in some country in the south america for example i 'd like to live in argentina at least for a few years but
i think this is a good topic to talk about yeah i think one of the main advantages is that if we permit our students to do fitness class yeah this is going to help them to develop a healthy lifestyle in the future about i say one of the main disadvantages would be that they probably would have less time to work on other subjects so we have to take that into consideration my opinion i think from my perspective or from my point of view i 'd say that we should always choose to schedule some fitness lessons and fitness classes periodically probably
okay i 'm going to give a quick presentation about how honey yeah goes from flower to shop i think the first stage is that the bees collect nectar from flowers and then the bees make honey from nectar and it behaves after that the man who are beekeepers collect honey from behaves and and then this honey end up in the shelves of the shops so
yeah i think students should consider many things for example what language is spoken in that country even the country so far is too far from the origin country because sometimes you want to get fly and can be very very expensive
when you study in a second language the main advantage is that you are going to learn other languages
so try to be out as much as possible
yeah i totally agree with the people who think that because i think when you are alone in other countries you have to face so many difficulties every single day so it 's going to help you to become more independent yeah this is for sure own
i live in seville and seville is the best city around the world it has a lot of culture issues for example the cathedral of seville and the giralda it 's amazing and the food is good
on holidays i used to go to the beach with my family but right now i am working in a swimming pool so i will not go with my family this year but i will go with my boyfriend on weekends
well in the future i mean i would like to have a government job and help people that need at least economic help
well to have a part of at the same time that you are studying at university could be really hard the advantages are that you could save money to spend on a good master when you finished your degree and you know what are your limits and the disadvantages are that you do n't have enough free time to spend with your family or your friend go to the cinema or go to the beach in my opinion this is really rich because you learn how to organize yourself you need to know how time will you spend studying and how time are you working on your life
well travel in a plane could be complicated but it is easier than you think first of all you ca n't forget your passport and your documentation first you take a car a taxi or a bus to go to the airport one time that you are there you will do your checking with a person that will help you then then you should wait a minute and you could go to the bathroom or take some coffee then you will board and it is all
well nowadays every company has a new technology and people have to adapt to the globalization so this year technology was really important because of covid
well in the future students probably will need to work in groups so you will need to be a good team working in my opinion it is a great idea
that is how you will do your exam
in my opinion this is really really important for public schools and universities because if they do n't have resources governments should provide them
personally i 'm very interested in the environment because there is no planet b so we have to take care a lot of this because in the future our zones are going to live in the earth and we have to keep it the better we can together
i met most of my friends in the travel agency where i used to work so the thing that we really enjoy the most is traveling all together especially to mexico because we love the beaches over there and all the food and the traditions
i would say that i am very close to my mom because she is the one who spends more time with me and we are also creating a business together so we do really enjoy doing the same things as for example producing this handmade jewelry brown
two years ago i had the opportunity to study abroad in the us and there i discovered miami so i would say that miami it 's my kind of place where always there 's good weather and many plans to do so definitely i would love to live there in the future
when talking about introducing fitness classes at schools i would say that there are more advantages than either disadvantages for it because it is undeniable that getting to do exercises at least thirty minutes a day it helps to be in a better shape and to be healthier in the future so i would say that these are the main advantages on the other hand the disadvantages is that they will take a lot of time out of the students to get ready for it and then shower after doing those fitness classes
so today we are going to go through the whole process from how the honey goes from a flower to the shop so firstly the bees are collecting the nectar from the flowers especially during the spring and they are making that honey nectar in their beehives which they are their homes so once the vehicle collectors are staring at those beehives and see that there 's a bunch of honey they collect it and they send it to the manufacturing companies that they actually put it into individual recipients after that those companies are the ones that transport it and sell to the stores then we are able to get it from there when we go to the supermarkets
based on my personal experience a candidate that is trying to choose a country where to study abroad the first thing that they have to take into account is the language because otherwise it is going to be very difficult for them to follow all the classes and to be integrated in the classroom
so the benefits of studying in a second language they are very clear because you get to know more people and you are able to travel by yourself to more countries where you are going to have more possibilities to express yourself to other people
i think that there are many barriers that you could face when studying in another country for instance not only the language itself because you can learn that but the traditions and the culture in there at the very beginning can be very shocking for a foreign student
when you are abroad you have to really learn the local culture by hanging out with locals if you just keep hanging out with international people you are not going to be immersed in that and it is not going to be as beneficial as possible
personally i totally agree with that statement because for many people when you study abroad it is the first time becoming independent without your parents and you learn how to actually manage your house and all doing the groceries and everything
i 'm from cadiz but i live in granada because i study there granada is a fantastic city but the unique problem has n't got beach
holiday i love to go to the beach go out with my friend go to the party with my friend and visit my friend from other cities
he has three years more than me and we will expert with it
i 'm studying psychology and in the future i would like to be a neuropsychologist because i like the different neuropathologies
vintage is that you can be more responsible and and the disadvantage is time is more difficult work and study but in my opinion all students should work and study at the same time in the last year of their degree
when you travel by plane the first thing is travel to the airport you can travel by car by bus or by train when you arrive to the airport the first thing that you have to do is the checking and then you have to show your document control and pass the security control then after that you can wait and taking a coffee the shopping go to the toilets and at the time of your plane you board off in the plane and then you fly and start
i do n't agree with this because for example there are a lot of degrees and master online and in my opinion i think that there are a good option to study
for working in group projects i think that the organization is important to listen to your partner
i am living with my family with two siblings and my grandparents the place where i live is pre story building and small garden in front of it and
actually i do a lot of activity on holiday i usually spend some quality of time with my friends and family i occasionally visit some places which is in my city and i seldom play cricket and volleyball with my friends
it is no doubt in my brother he is my andrew brother and he is quite funny and sometimes we spend a lot of time together we enjoy the dinner together we enjoy talking and some sharing information with each other and i usually play cricket with him a lot
so in the future i want to be a computer engineer i have completed my bachelor 's right now so i want to be a good programmer i guess in the future and it was very helpful for me to build my career
there are many advantages when students get a job to pay for their university studies to begin with if students do a job while studying at university they will be very independent from their parents so it is very advantageous for them apart from them also they get and widen their knowledge in different fields when there are also several disadvantages to being a part time job or to be doing a part time job during their university studies first of all they can not cope up with their studies because they find maybe difficulty with their course and it might be getting hurt in their exam situation so sometimes student may have failed
now i 'm going to talk about how to traveling by plane and all the process required to do at airports first of all individuals have to travel by a car taxi or bus or train to the airport after that they have to provide their passport and some documents so that the airport authority will verify you and then individual have to pass from security process and then wait for their flight so when flight is arrived you will be notified by the authority of airport and then you have to find your seat in airport according to your tickets and then flight will take off from the you know airport and
students can now use technology in various ways apart from that they can you know gathering information from various sources through the internet it will be very helpful for them in study
to my perspective to best study is quite beneficial for a student as a teacher can notice the behavior of student and they can find some mistake of a student and also give some wise advice how to improve that mistakes and
various skill students can improve by studying and working in a group the sense of communication is increasing while working group
from my perspective attending lecture is quite interesting rather than reading alone in contrast whenever you read alone you know you yourself find the boring but in contrast whenever you attending a lecture you can interact with your peers as well as your teacher so it may be beneficial
and so the student can learn more they can get a better job in the future
well the place where i live is a small city in the south of spain what i most like is that people are very friendly there are very good environments in the streets
due to my work i do n't have a lot of holidays but any case what i most like doing is to travel abroad with my family in order to improve my knowledge about other cultures and customs
the person who i most enjoy spend my time is my song because he 's so lovely what i
in the future i would like to continue working as a teacher at the university because i really love these jobs
in one hand if you work while you are studying you have the opportunity to have money for travel and do other things apart from be focused on your studies on the contrary if you spend time working you have less time for study perhaps your academic result could be less satisfactory than you expect but
the first step is to travel to the airport in your old car or by public transport once you are in the airport you have to go to the checking table and present your identification and leave your baggage there after applying your work card you have to pass the security control but before you have to show your identification once you have done the security tip you can wait in the restaurants and after that you can board and take off
working in group projects to develop mainly skill related with the collaboration the self confident organization of the world
they must provide facilities in order to be with them
well i live in madrid it is a really big and huge city and and it 's known because of a high population of chinese people so it 's like the chinatown of madrid so we have a lot of multiculturality in our neighborhood
well i really like to relax and do not think about my work or study or anything so i really like to watch series and tv shows just hanging out with my friends going to the swimming pool or even to the beach if i can reading books and just have time for myself spending time for myself
i like spending time with my sister because she is like four years older than me and we 're very similar in personality and hobby so i really like spending time with her speaking about anything that happens in our daily life because she does n't live with me anymore so
well i 'm preparing myself for being a scientist so i would really like to do science and i am looking for a phd position and something related with neuroscience and i would really like to research and just find something that could help people with neurogenerative diseases like alzheimer 's
i think the good things about working while you are studying in the university is that you can earn your own money so it makes you realize how important and difficult it is to get your own money and sustain yourself i also think that helps you develop skills like social skills and working under pressure although i think that it is actually really complicated to work while you are studying possibly probably they are not going to get as good marks that you might be able to and you will have to spend more time or less time meeting your friends and doing stuff you like in my personal opinion no one should be obligated to do it only you want to i think government should pay tuition
the first thing you have to do is get to the airport you can do it using different transports you can go by car by bus or by train there are different things and also you can take a taxi or any other private transport once you get there in you will have to show your ticket and your identification card and go to the document control depending on the place you 're gon na go you will need to do it even twice afterwards you have to go through security afterwards you will have to wait until you can get into the plane and you will work you will sit in the plane and you are just ready to enjoy your flight
there are different ways to use technology in order to study better study for example you can watch many youtube videos that help you out a lot for example in mathematics i think you can use it in different resources in my case for example i 'm a biologist and i really need to read papers and internet is the way
i absolutely agree with that idea i think that teachers are really important well they ca n't explain to you exactly to you just for you and you can ask them anything so it 's really helping helps you learn
yeah i think so while and there 's much information you get and it 's sometimes easier to understand stuff and so one of those explaining to you talking not just reading
it 's really important nowadays teachers use slides to explain stuff you also need laptops and universities should give you laptops you do n't have your own laptop and your library should be modern enough you have to have your catalog on the internet
i have a lot of forests and parks with lagoon so i really like it the outdoor when i have around myself but it 's a beautiful place
and that 's my life
and not only is my mom but also is my sister so that she are all for me so i really love her and my sister too
i really would like to be an animator in disney or dreamworks industries or i have a lot of possibilities in the arts
for that reason we can be a grad student but we really need to understand that one of the disadvantages are the accumulation of all topics subjects and assignments when we are in the jobs so please focus on what is more important my so you can get job and pay later your university or
later you need to go to the station and you need to check in on your white page then when it 's time to go to the plane you need to board and take off the plane
these students use technology principally to focus and investigate some new topics at idioms which videos about one thing and write and do homework
the subject could be ethics a lot of justice arts in this case they can improve their abilities about the art communication and give some score and feedback about something
all depends about the students someone who will be majoring with a long reading order it 's better to attend your lectures but it all depends about the students and their best way to study
what i mean is this twenty - first century is the age of the technology
the place where i live is a little town next to the sea in costa brava is a little village and it 's so cool to live there because there are n't so much people and it 's very quiet
the thing that i most enjoy when i 'm in holiday is going to the beach and swimming in the sea and hanging out with my friends sleeping till very late and basically doing nothing
i could n't choose between my mother and my father i love them both and i love enjoying my time with both of them
in the future i will be a teacher and i 'm studying at the university to reach my dream
i am a university student and i see the reality of this topic the advantages are that you learn experience and also money but there are a lot of disadvantages for example in my case i could n't work in a studio at the same time because university takes all my time i have a lot to study and it 's impossible for me to work and also there 's a lot of people like me that they can complain about the studio and the work and in my opinion is this you study and if you work you work but
this is a summary of how is traveling by airplane at first play you have to go to the airport you can use a car and bus a train a taxi once you 're there you have to go to the terminal and after that the check in they will check your log edge after that you to show your i d identification and after that you go to security they will check that your bug is safety and then when you pass the security you will have to wait until it 's time to boarding the plane and when you board the plane then you can go
they can use technology in some different ways with the computers and tablets we have a lot of information and we can use the internet to make all the work and all the studies that we need
in my opinion i prefer to attend to a face to face class because i think i can focus more on what the teacher is saying and i can take better notes
working on group projects is a good way to work because it has a lot of benefits for everyone in the group the task we learn to work together and cooperating and i think it 's very useful
well i think that attending two lectures is worse than reading for your own because you are not as focused as if you were who is reading and that 's why i think it 's better reading for your own
for the universities the learning facilities are a basic thing they had to provide a good learning facilities for the students so they can make their degree effectively
i like playing the trumpet with my father or with the band on friday on sunday i like staying with my family at home
i think the best way is to go abroad to england for example but it 's very difficult for me because i do n't have enough money however i think the best option is to study in an english academy
so i think i could work about that
on the one hand you can earn money if you work and you can help your parents because who pay for all the studies on the other hand it 's very difficult studying and working at the same time these perjudicate our studies it 's difficult to pass with a height mark in all cases so
and some of them fall down to the forest and lakes the sea other particle mixed with the water and when it 's raining or snowing this particle falls down to a
i recommend other people to eat healthy food for example vegetables salad because the fast food is bad for us
it 's very important because our body needs this water all food has water and the expert recommends us to drink one liter a day
in my opinion is very important
i think it 's positive for example the social network can show different health habits for
i live in a small town that is surrounded by nature and you have many hiking routes to do in the town
when i 'm on holidays i enjoy to hang out with friends and also to spend time with my family that is not near to me during the whole year and i also like to travel to and discover new places that i do n't know
i really enjoyed spending time with my sister because she does n't live with me and i really like being with her and spending quality time with her because she 's a very important person in my life and i really love to have time with her
i would like to be a holder manager but i do n't know if it 's going to be possible but i 'm going to work on a tourist company because this is what i studied and this is the thing that i 'm going to work in
in my opinion students have to work to pay the university studies if their families do n't have the enough resources to affront that cost but i think if they have the economic support of their families they should not work because i think that that 's one touch of work to pay the studies that you have in economy depends and you do n't have to depend on your parents but it is going to take to take too many time you must be studying or many rest time that you need to have energy and to improve and to have good results on your studies from the university studies
so this graph shows us the different steps that you have to follow to travel by airplane as we can see the first step is that you have to travel to the airport you can do it by car by train or by bus then you have to do the checking on your travel company and this is that step then the next step is that you have to pass the document control with the police and then you have to pass the security control where they are going to check your lab then you have to wait before the boarding time on the airport you have many things to do like shopping have a coffee have a lunch and then do come board to the plane
i think that students can search on the internet to many different articles that can help us to improve their learning of stuff
i think that learn face to face with the teacher is the best way to learn because you have the person in front of you to ask him or the question that you have and they can help you with your issues
for me it works better reading alone because i prefer to be myself with my thoughts i prefer this way of reading than attending to group lectures where they can distract you i do n't know for me it 's better reading alone
i think that is very helpful
the place where i live is quiet and there 's not a lot of people so you can sleep well here there 's a lot of nature it 's a village it 's not a city so that 's it
when i 'm on holiday i love to go to the swimming pool and swim and be with my friends there if it 's raining i like to do other things like stay at home watching netflix watching series
i like to spend time with my brother my brother is one year old more than me so we are very friends we spend all the time together we do a lot of things like we go running we go swimming and we go climbing
so i would train them i guess
if students worked to pay their studies they would be more independent from their parents and also they would be more prepared for their real life because things have to be paid off and disadvantages i would say the time for studying is less so they might have worse marks in their degree so my opinion is that parents would support their children to pay their studies because not everyone but the majority of people want to study and have a future you know so i would say no
okay to travel by airplane you need tickets very important and some taxi or car or some friend who can take us to the airport and legal documents such as i d or passport okay well we will travel to the airport first and then when we 're in the airport we pass through they will check our documents of our ticket and when they call plus a board and then the plane will take off with us
i think it 's not maybe if you go to a lecture and you do n't understand what it 's planning and you are not motivated it 's more useful to read it and understand by yourself
it is very important to have good facilities such as a computer or a fast computer but definitely it 's not the most important for students i would say the most important is how they teach and not what they have to teach you know
i am very interesting
when i have free time i go to the kitchen to make a sandwich or i watch tv or watch videos or watch a tiktok
i practice my english with an app talking with outsiders
i want to be more flexible
the advantage that they can have is to learn more about the subject and do a good job the disadvantage may be that you forget some things that you had already done and
second acid particles in smoke third acid particles are worried by wind fourth some acid particles fall as dust fifth other acid particles mix with cold water and sixth acid particles are in rain or snow thank you so much for watching
when we are drinking water our skin is very beautiful and our health is so important
it 's very important to leave eight oars every night because our boy will be very tired
i am very interested because i am a biologist i studied the animals the plants all things that are related with environment
i usually go to a bar or to a restaurant in the weekend
probably i think that my mother because her character like me is a shy people but work a lot and
i want to live in madrid because it 's a big city and you have a lot of possibilities to work in my field that is science
i think that the worst disadvantage is that you have less time to study other subjects like science that i think is very important today
okay the honey production starts with the bees obviously because the bees collect nectar from flowers then the next step is when the bees make honey from nectar in beehives it 's an easy cycle to understand because all of us know how bees do the honey it 's a simple cycle
i think that the cost of the life because it 's very expensive you probably would n't go to this place and the near of your natural country and other things
if you know other languages you can go to other countries you can speak with people from other cultures and it 's better for your curriculum because you probably could obtain better work in the future
i think that the best difficult is the culture because if you go to other country you will find different situations on your life like if you want to take the bus it 's different if
i think that it is necessary to go out to a bar to a restaurant to a supermarket to a library to a museum to speak with the people of this country that you learn about this culture
of course because you need for example open a bank account or way or another
my favorite time of the year is spring time because everything is blooming the flowers are very nice i think the nature is awake the birds are chirping and yeah i think everything is very very wonderful outside marvelous
it is pretty important because i think if you would like to be well informed about the word and
good question i do n't really know i 'd like to buy a detached house and move there together with my family members it would be a good idea i think because i 'm a mother of two and four of my little children in a garden would be great i guess but it is not feasible at the moment and i 'd like to teach english later
as for me i would say that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience because there would be so many beneficial effects of it and i think it would be a good idea for the future employer and for him or her as an employee the disadvantages yeah maybe if the student knows about the work in a more detailed way it would hinder him or her to do that kind of job later but all in all i would say that it would be a brilliant idea to involve these courses
in this chart i can see the number of people who are interested in online pop music sites the red line depicts a kind of upward trend as far as those listeners are concerned we will listen to june 's nat and as far as songs for you is concerned we can see downward tendency because the number of listeners basically has dropped significantly and as far as music now side is concerned there is a kind of stagnating phenomenon because basically the number of those people who listen to this channel is basically stagnate
well this is an interesting question i think a good team leader should be ambitious should have expertise in the field where he or she works in my opinion he should be a good collaborative worker and others
this is a brilliant question maybe the problem can be that there is too much workload on each member and they can feel strenuous after a tiring working day it must be very difficult to divide equally the tasks
i do n't think so in my opinion for that collaboration and agreement is highly deliberately needed
this is a pretty good question in my opinion it can depend on the situation the the type of the company where the employees are basically employed so it depends but sometimes face to face situation is definitely needed it depends on the type of the problem
teams can function better than working alone however it depends on the type of the persons who are in the team
but while it 's a good city to spend time but in summer it 's so hot
i like to spend my free time with my mates in pubs or house of my friends for example i use to the computer game for example where i like to have more time
if you ask me i would select my sister because she is of a similar age than me so we have the same interests and we have a good communication tool so i would select my sister
well on the other hand the main disadvantage is the time that they must spend spending time for a student is a problem because in general they 're having a lot of time
okay regarding the question you must follow this instruction first obviously you must travel to the airport in a personal car bus train or something similar okay a lot of possibilities at this point in the airport you must check in and the assistant will be useful for you also you must speak with security personnel and document control personnel and well in this point after all you must wait which is desperate but you will have to do anything anyway so finally you can abort the plane before the plane takeoff in the ground and well good trip where to go
technology is without doubt a revolution to study also technology is dangerous and is a part of this training for the student
where to choose i would select probably books
regarding the question no in my opinion attending lectures are a better option than reading alone so do
i 'm not really interested in learning about other countries although i think it could be interesting
i enjoy spending my free time by playing video games with my friends or listening to some music
the best way for me to improve my english is by watching netflix films of earth series
if i could learn to do something new i would like to learn cooking because i really like eating
some of the advantages that you can have by doing a part time job while studying is that you can start earning some money and one of the disadvantages it has is that you can get this concentrated from doing other important things and my opinion is that although you can get this concentrated from school and important things it is a good thing since you are experimenting new things in your life
acid rain is formed when vehicles and factories produce pollution which makes acid particles in the smoke which then are carried by the wind and some of them fall as dust while others mix with cloud water which then fall in the form of rain or snow damaging the environment causing acid rain
they should think about which nutrients are the best for their body and ca n't maintain them in shape
it is important for conserving energy and maintaining hydrated the body
i think it 's not an essential thing as long as you have good eating habits and you drink a lot of water
well it is proved that this is the most optimum time for us to rest and sleep so i think people should have a real controlled sleep schedule
i think it has had a bad impact on people since they have stopped paying attention to a lot of important things and they just see social media
it 's a very peaceful and quiet place and all of his people meet themselves and are family or friends
when i am on holidays i love to swim at the sea and play volleyball on the beach with my friends yes
i always dream it to work in the future to a social educator yes because i love to help people and
well let 's have a look okay one of the advantages of this is that the students could study at the university all the advantages is that if the students study at the university they will get a good work in the future well one of disadvantages is the students have less time to study and they maybe can hand out with her friends in my opinion the university might be more cheaper
well first obviously you must go to the airport you can go on bus on train or in your car okay when you arrive to the airport you must pass the checking and the security control after that you must wait for the plane around two hours more or less and you can wait in the restaurant and you can go to the we say or cafe or shopping then you board to the plane and finally you relax and travel
students maybe can use the technology to study because there are some websites with a lot of information about different topics and students might find this interesting
in my opinion learning face to face with the teacher is a good way to learn
depends reading alone is so good to learn about a topic but attending lectures is another good thing to learn about
it 's too important that university gives to the students facilities like web books dictionaries etc
i 'm interested around my environment is clean and temperature comfortable and that 's all
i 'm happy to do with my friend is going to karaoke
my mother is very similar to me
so this advantage is that all students have become improved because they are in this society so a lot of students do n't move their body but this advantage so if they have a handicap so they can join the class classes so they have but things but fears so my opinion is the courage make the fitness classes because their health is more improved
so i will explain how to make the sixth step to make the honey so from flour to shop one bees collect nectar from flour and the second step bees make honey from nectar in beehives and the next step be keepers collect honey from beehives and the honey move to the shop and selling
so studying in a second language 's advantage is they can talk a lot of people the other countries and
the first step so to another country before they move another country they have to search in the web and
they 're becoming independent in other country because they have to do themselves for themselves cleaning on the cooking or the speaking so
i 'm fond of learning different countries because it is significant for me it 's absolutely interesting for me
as i work a lot when i have a free time i try to have a rest i am fond of outdoor activities such as biking riding bicycles having fun walking
as for me the best way to improve my english is speaking constantly writing different essay reading various books and listening in various of podcasts
i am fond of interesting different literature and i like to do various research
i think yes all university students should do part time jobs because there are a lot of advantages of it they can earn their own money and they spend them that only they want but
i think there are a lot of problems connected with factories and vehicles because factories produce a lot of harmful emissions also all vehicles produce a lot of carbon dioxide emissions so in result we get a pollution hour ecosystem so these acid particles are in smoke and we smell this pollution and acid particles are carried by wind some acid particles will fall as dust other acid particles mix with cloud water and acid particles are in rain or snow so we are forest to smell this pollution
i think it is significant for every person to drink enough water during the day because we lose our water balance and we must to fill our cells with water and
of course i think it is necessary for people to start every day with morning exercises it is not necessary to go to the gym to do some exercises but it 's enough to do stretching exercises
it depends on what side do you look of course there are advantages of using technologies in our life because various apps related to our health and exercises can help you to keep healthy lifestyle
i 'm really interested in the environment because i 'm studying marine environment organisms and also i 'm conscious and conscient with the problems problems in world warming and
i have a lot of friends and i enjoy with them practicing some water sports and
we are a lot of characteristics in commons and we are patients and
i would like to live in the future in menorca because i think it 's a great place to have a child and also i have my family in that island
so nowadays almost all the colleges and schools dedicate part of their time to fitness classes and their consequences have some advantages and disadvantages the first advantage to do fitness classes is that the students could learn how to practice or do some sport in their house also the disadvantages to doing fitness in classes is that some students could n't fold the rules and did n't take these classes seriously and then could be a waste of time for these kinds of students in my opinion it 's a great idea
so i 'm going to talk about an interesting process in which bees make honey and then we found in the supermarkets bees collect nectar from the flowers and it depends if the kind of flower that bees are looking the pollen could be one or other kind of honey there mono floral honey and base it in multi floral components the bees transport the nectar to the beehives and then they store it in the honey inside it 's the work of beekeepers to collect honey from the beehivers and they have to take some cautions because the bees are dangerous insects
so i think that learn a second language is very profitable in terms of cultural richness and also to earn more money it 's a great skill and could open a lot of windows in your world
so learn another new language is a very spend time and sometimes there are some cultural problems but i think that if you have a good attitude you can learn properly and will be a better person
the easiest way for a student to know the culture of the country abroad is making local friends or speaking with natives they are who best could teach them their culture
so generally it is i am a student abroad and i have to say that i 'm more independent and i learned a lot of things that i could n't learn if i stayed just at home so they agree and
definitely my mother i look like my personality is same as her personality and i love her so much
young people need to do a lot of exercise so there are many benefits in doing fitness classes at school or college because they can grow up healthy and active there are some drawbacks we can say because they can hurt herself and sometimes maybe they can feel bad but
well firstly this collect nectar from flowers and transport this nectar from the e highs where make honey from nectar then big keepers with un special equipment to avoid being chopped collect honey from big hives and after that they bottle up the honey the last is they transport the honey to the supermarket to be sold
i mean it will be nearby their country to go and back frequently
if you have a chance to travel abroad you can communicate with other people if you have a second language for example english is used around the world so it 's really useful
if they do n't know well the language maybe they can find difficult to communicate if they have to go to the doctor or do any documents
it 's essential to know about the local country if you are living abroad because you know well the way to live there and
this situation helps them to live independent without the parents
i reckon i 'm most similar to my mother we think that 's the same way and also people say that i look like her physically so yeah i look similar to her
well i like many countries including spain but i think that if i have to choose one i will go to italy because it 's a country that i have ever seen like it 's the best country
well there are many advantages for example they can relax if they are so stressed because of studies i do n't consider that sports have disadvantages but well if i have to say one i will say that students can become obsessed with sports we know that when they are teenagers they do n't feel so comfortable with their bodies so it will be dangerous if they become obsessed in my opinion sport is an essential activity for stay healthy so young people should practice it very often
we usually buy honey at shops but have you ever thought how is it produced well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and with this nectar bees make honey in baby heaps then the beekeepers take the honey from the bee heaps and the next step is to put the honey in a receipt so as to be distributed in shops and finally the honey is in the stock so people come buy it
i think that i wo n't have any doubts about choosing a country which is what it will be italy since i was a leader i have always wanted to go there i do n't know why but i will choose it yet
i think that it helps us to travel around the world because we can communicate with other people also we can find a job at quicklears if we know how to speak another language
i believe that at first the most difficult thing is to get on with people however by the time you find it easy
i think that the most easy way to learn about the culture is traveling around the local place so you can find many cultural landmarks
yes i totally agree because you are alone when you go abroad to study so
so i live apart from where i 'm originally from so in my holiday i go back to my home not to spend time with my family especially with my brother i play the video game just like once a year it 's like a competition and it is really fun
i told it to plebius question however it 's going to be my little brother this is because i play the video game with him or we play the same sport baseball so we do a couch together and a lot of the time spending is really always fun
i would like to have the job of airline pilot this is because it was just my childhood dream since i was very little and also this is sometimes calling the dream too and so i think that 's what i want to be
i think that there are lots of plows and cons of getting the job to pay for the university studies the first one of the advantages is that you can get the job experience to explore what you are interested in and also try to figure out what the student needs in the future like specific skills and anything that the student can learn and also the disadvantage would be that the focus will be on the job not the study and in my opinion that the students should do a little bit of a job however they should mainly focus on their study in the university and in that way you can explore your interests
so nowadays a lot of people travel a lot so i will present about how to travel by the airplane you have three steps after you got to the airport until you board to the airplane so once you get to the airport you have to check in your luggage and also i give the clerk your identification and a ticket and then you will go through the document control and in the document control you have to show your passport and identification to check you are the light person to get in and also the finance security you get on board
i think the best thing about the technology on studying is that you do n't have to carry a lot of book textbooks and notes i think if you got an ipad or something like the technology you can take a note on that and also you can see the textbook on that
yeah i think the learning on face to face is great but this is because i can show the teacher where the part that i do n't get it and the teacher can focus on just teaching on that to me
this is because the students will explain to each other about what you got and in that way the knowledge stays in your mind
yes i think so too this is because you can understand where teachers just focus it on by his or her tone of speaking and also the pace of speaking so yeah
really it 's a good question
a lot of things when i stay with my friends we usually to journey to the mountains take photos and mainly stay together
if i had to choose one i choose my uncle because he loves photography and i love photography too and we speak a lot about that
if i could choose a good life with my brother in panama city because it 's a big city and wonderful city and i love it
as i see it the main advantage of two fitness classes at the schools and college is the health of their students regarding the disadvantage i reckon that they are less than the advantage the main disadvantage in my opinion is the student 's tiredness i mean if they arrive tired to other classes their performance will go down as far as i 'm concerned the fact of doing any kind of exercise at the schools and college is good for the students and for the professor in general
honey from flower to shop the first part of the process is bees collecting nectar from flowers lara this makes honey from the nectar in beehives and the beekeepers collect this honey in glasses or bottles of glass this
let 's see at first time i think it 's a disadvantage because you ca n't understand anything but with the time you can understand a lot and
when you are a student in another country you can go to local clubs or a lot of things for now this culture
i agree with this statement because in my case i live with my parents and i do n't know how is live for my life alone life independent and is a disadvantage
i can get to the beach in only ten minutes on foot
i enjoy going to surfing i often go to surfing because my house is very close to the beach
i want to be a pilot because i can go to anywhere all around the world
i think there are two advantages for students first they can acquire new skills second they can manage themselves about their money on the other hand they spend less time studying this is a disadvantage for students i think students should not get jobs to pay for their university studies because it is important for students to study
i will give you a presentation about traveling by airplane first travel to airport you can get taxi or train or buses to airport and you passed all this section you have to wait the minutes you can go to cafe you can buy something and yeah after you can get on brain
i think so too because to study it is important for studying something to ask some questions so it is important
they can acquire a skill to communicate with someone and can achieve together a same thing
i think so because attending lectures the teacher can give us a main point to study
i enjoy a lot of things when i end with my friends like go to the parties together watch the series or movies in english or spanish listen to music together in spanish or in english so i love spending time with my friends
i think there is my mom because my mona have a same qualities with like me and i love my mom and
i want to live to germany because one part of my family lives in this country and i love its culture its customs its people lives in this country and i love germany and i want to live in this country
hi everyone today i 'm going to talk about the schools and college should make time in the school day for all the students to do business classes i think that is the topic it 's so very important because this one has a lot of advantage for example all the students increase your happiness increase your lifestyle maybe increase a lot of things the principal increase your positive attitudes increase your mental your health is healthy lifestyle i think there is one that do n't have a disadvantage maybe i think there is no very stressful for the students in my opinion it 's so very important that all the students study business classes every day and i think that it 's very important that the schools include these business fitness classes i think that is very important
hi everyone today i 'm going to talk about how honey is produced and so the collect nectar from flowers so the second step is the bees make honey for nectar in beehives and the next step is the beekeepers collect honey for bee heaps and i think that is very important
obviously it 's very difficult to start in another country because you are away from your family
yes i think if you have an opportunity to start in another country you 'll be coming to independent and i think that is very useful in your life because
when i do n't have any obligation i 'm keen on watching series and films and also listening to music as i think it helps me to relax myself and another hobby that i have is cooking which i think i 'm really good at
actually with my mom as we have lots of things in common we both are adventurous we like to visit new places and also we love to train and do exercise so we have a really good time when we are together and i love her
as i 'm into ballet i hope i can spend the rest of my life practicing it so i wish i can join a company and become a professional dancer
in my opinion it is great for students to take jobs as their parents wo n't have to pay for everything and it will be easier and cheaper for them also students can earn work experience and they will be more qualified when they finish college but the disadvantages are that they wo n't have much time left to study and that 's why they will have to be really well organized in order to be able to do both activities studying and working also this could be really tiring in my opinion this would be an awesome experience for students and really helpful for their parents so it 's a really good option
hi everyone today i will explain which are all the things you need to do to travel by airplane first of all as you see in the first picture you need to travel to the airport and you can choose any mean of transport you want for example you can go by car by bus or by train then after you arrive there you will need to do the check in where your documents will be controlled there 's also a security control where the luggage you 'll board with you on the plane will be checked then you will be free to wait in an area where you can buy presents eat something or you can go to the bathroom then you 'll finally be able to board on your plane and after all that steps your flight will start thank you so much for watching and i 'll see you in the next video
in fact it has a lot of advantages for example students can write long documents or reports faster and in an easier way also they 'll be able to save them all in the same place and in addition they can search for any information they need on the internet and do investigations
in my opinion times are changing and there are a lot of people that have started learning virtually so it has been proved that both methods have their own advantages and it 'll depend on each student which one to choose maybe depending on their likes and preferences
they can get to know how to get organized when they are working with other people for example how to involve each other 's opinions
definitely as i think that teachers can explain any subject in a more interesting and easy way
and i think many tourists come in there
i often enjoy baking sweets for example chiffon cake and i feel happy when my family eats and tells me it is delicious
my little sister enjoy playing catch ball with me because and c likes baseball very much
i think the advantages of all students getting jobs to pay for their university students is students can get the working skills in advance i think it will be useful in their future and the disadvantage is that students can not concentrate on their study in my opinion the most important thing for the students is definitely so
i 'll explain what you need to do to travel by airplane firstly you have to go to airport by car or train or something and next you have to pass the document control and security and if you go abroad you need to show a passport and the check is it 's finished you wait
by studying together students can get communication skills to cooperate with other members i think it will be useful in their future so it is very important in education
running facility is very important because if we gave the good running facilities students can concentrate on their study more
i am very interested in the environment because i see nowadays we live in a pandemic with the contamination and it 's necessary to save the planet for this reason i practice a vegan diet rich in plant proteins
it 's a difficult question because we go to different places but usually we go to the beach and prepare a little picnic with jam food and we talk about our life
i think i 'm most similar with my little brother because we love the same activities we watch the same movies science fiction in this case
in the future i really like to live in the same place when i live in this moment because i really love my island i love to wake up in the morning and see the ocean
on the one hand icing is a good initiative with the schools because nowadays obesity is a global pandemic in the world usually in kids on the other hand i think it 's not a good idea because i think everybody decides for a personal decision practice or more practice sports in my opinion it 's a difficult question for me because i do n't know i think it 's good but i do n't disagree with the idea
first bees collected nectar from the different flowers then these bees made honey from nectarine behavior one time later beekeepers collected honey from behavior and put the honey in different bottles then
the advantage of studying second language of course is you learning and you practice and practice and practice this idiom when you finish your study you are an expert in this language
i think the most difficult firstly is the language of course it depends on the places but i think it 's the language and then i think for example the weather if you go to for example poland the weather or gran canarian poland is completely different
i think students learn many cultures typical places for example sitters music and so on but i think the most important is the food because food is an important culture in every place
i think it 's a real because this year i went to erasmus and when i got home i am become independent with my family because one year in our country you change absolutely personality
my favorite time of year i think is my birthday i really like this day the twenty - ninth of october because i used to celebrate my birthday with all my family my boyfriend
to me it 's really important because i really want to be aware of what is happening in the world so just to read the newspaper i mean every morning
i used to spend my time with my sister playing games and
i hope to be working in a fashion company as human resource because it 's my dream since i was a child and if it 's not possible i would like to work as a buyer because i really like the fashion world
i think the period of practical work experience is the best way to find what you want to do in the future in my case for example i did n't know if i wanted to be a lawyer or if i wanted to be a human resource so i started my internship in a company and it was fantastic it was the best experience to me however one of the disadvantages was that i need to go to the company to be in practice but i needed to go to the university as well to go class so this was the worst experience
so as we can see in the graphic tunisnet started very bad and now it 's one of the three most listening online pop music sites so it was great for tunisnet however sounds for you a star not too bad but now is the less listen side and music now a star world start no bad increase a lot but then is decreasing so tunisnet is the best one because she starts too bad and now it 's increasing and increasing a lot
to be a good team leader the person needs to be very serious needs to be very sensible and needs to be very good under pressure
the problem i think is when you did n't know the person because working with another people is not really easy so the problem i think is that one you need to know about this person
i do n't know about this because in my opinion if you are a good worker you will be good working face to face or work at home so i do n't know
if you have a good team obviously you will have better results than if you are alone however i 'm this kind of person that prefers to work alone because
the kabuki performance many times held in there
i usually enjoy watching movies with english subtitles to learn english and english i like action movies for example the avengers and iron man and so on
i have brother i enjoy usually playing game or playing catch ball and playing music and so on with he so
so i want to become a pilot in the future
in my opinion all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies is very good things i have two reasons
first traveling airplane we have to go to the airport by your car or bus or train arrival at airport first you need checking at the counter next document control and security passed and then you can wait to board at front of boarding bridge and next after all you can board the airplane and go to the other place or at country anywhere in the us
they can use many applications on the phone for example for english words to learn they do not necessarily carry heavy books
i agree with this opinion because if they have any questions they can ask to the teacher so that is opinion
so i think group project is needed to learn
yes i think so because if the students have any questions they can ask the teacher as soon as possible
from my point of view learning from another country should be one of the most important issues in life due to the fact that you are interested in learning a new culture or learning a new language it is important to meet
what i like the most for enjoying my free time is to be with friends to be with family and
i am trying many things to improve my english
if i had the opportunity to learn a new skill i would probably choose to learn to play piano the reason why is because i have always loved music and
my opinion about to get a part job during the time we are in the high school i mean during the university is that there are few advantages which mean that they can get money and they can be free and they can be independent from their parents and on the other hand there are few disadvantages as they are for instance that you have less time for studying you have less time for spending with your friends as well and with your girlfriend and apart from that i think it 's not nothing wrong with that so
there are factories and vehicles that create some tiny particles into the air which is called pollution these tiny particles become part of the atmosphere and when they get in that and they mist with the clouds they convert in little piece of water that once that is rain this piece of water falls down and comes into the ground which cause tremendous damage to environmental it is called acid rain this is the wind that moves the particles from where the factories and vehicles are today these are natural environmental
it 's one of the best things people can do in order to recharge their batteries
well at the moment i am not having a lot of holidays because i am studying a lot but if i had holidays i would go on the beach and to see the mountains
let me a few seconds to collect my thoughts
i love this question because nowadays i 'm studying nursing and i love really much this job
well the advantages maybe are if they get money to pay their career they will help their families and get some new skills for their future but as far as i 'm concerned i think that it 's very useful to work while you are studying because this way you can prepare to the real war it 's
if you are thinking going on a holiday you may know some tips to get by plane first of all you may choose the way to arrive to the airport and then you must do a check in showing your passport or identification card to the control place there will be an agent of security and you must be very patient with it then if you have to wait till your plane leaves you can take a coffee then you are going abroad and then you enjoy your trip thank you
let me a few seconds to collect my thoughts
well to be honest this is not a topic i really talk to
no i 'm not so sure about that because when you are reading alone you have more concentration and you may get some skills alone
okay i live in a rural area so it is the best
in my holiday i often go to the park to play soccer with my friends who are majoring in engineering which is same as me friends
most times i often go to the park to play soccer with my brother in my who is in family member and we always enjoy it
that 's a good question in the future i would like to be an online pilot so there are two reasons to be an online pilot and the first one is i like to control something and the second one is i like to member in the team
so there are two advantages that students get jobs to pay for their university studies i mean first one is students can improve like communication skill in the job per term job and second one is that they can learn about how to use money to use and the disadvantage is that if they have so much like work be they do n't have much time to study which is the most important for student and my own opinion in my opinion i recommend that students should get jobs i mean you know like communication skill and experience in the job is very useful and important for society
alright so i am talking about what we need to do to travel by the airplane so there are one two three four five six seven eight procedures and first step is that we travel to the airport by a curb by a bus or by a train and then when you arrived at the airport you have to check in to the counter and you have to show the document about yourself and the counter people check the document and then also you have to check the security like your security and then you can have time to wait to take a rest or drink a coffee and then after that you will board to the airplane and then enjoy flying
okay so i 'm talking about how can you use technology more effectively to study and i think the best way to use technology to study is to use like application in the smartphone bad
yeah i agree with that i mean you know face to face like studying and learning is that it 's good for like communication with other people like
in group projects students can get communication skills for example like if there is someone who does n't know about it and someone can teach to someone and it 's good
i mean they 're just going to the class and taking a lecture so it 's easy to take it
i think it is not so important to take modern learning facilities in the school i mean if there is it 's better but it does n't matter that we have learned or not
i always have been interesting to learn about other countries actually i have been living in italy and in new zealand as well because i want to learn from other cultures the way that they live the way that they eat and also learning about that new place
the most part of my free time i 'm outside i we can say that we go to climb mountain biking and hiking
i have two main techniques to improve my english one of that is try to speak in english with every speaker person english person that i find and on the other hand i try to watch every movie and every tv show in english if i can
probably i will choose to learn to drive a motorbike i never been a good driver even cars so on the last two years i have been seriously thinking about to get a cool motorbike but on the other hand i do n't have the license so
like every decision in life when we work when we are studying at the university it has some advantages and disadvantages one good advantage is when you are working and studying at the same time you can use the theory and the learns and knowledge that you are getting when you are studying and put it in practice when you work at the same time that part time work gives you some economy resources that you can use on your daily basis on the other hand it has some disadvantages as well for example you have less time to spend with your friends you have less time to study and you have less time to practice sport so in my opinion it 's all about to find a good balance between your part time your student time and your work time
the acid rain is one of the main consequence of our activity as a human being on this planet all the start with our factories and our vehicles that produce smoke that smoke carry on too many acid particles that they go up until the sky and why i say in our food because that particles go to the water and that water have the fishes that we later will eat so at the end all that pollution get in our own bodies at the same time that rain get into the fruit that we eat as well on the forest and on the farms
it 's that simple processed food does n't give you enough calories processed food poison you so stop
drinking water is as important as breathe we actually need water for survive we just have to think that most part of our bodies are water so we have to refuel that amount of water with drinking at least one liter per day at least
yes it 's absolutely essential to do exercise every day when we say that we do n't have to think about to do a sport when we say exercise it can be walking around your neighborhood
i agree with that but on the other hand the reality is that there are people who just ca n't sleep for six hours and they work really well it just depends on the person
technology has mainly bad effects on the people because they do n't use it on the right way technology can provide us too many apps which we can learn how to eat how to exercise and how to sleep well
a lot i 've been studying about other countries since i was little kid so i can say it a lot
i like to enjoy it by doing some sports namely playing some football then i enjoy hanging out with my friends and
i think it is to interact with the native english speakers so they can advise me how to speak properly properly their language and studying some grammar and some vocabulary
the power of communication because i think it is very important to communicate with other people in a good way so they can have a good image of us
university students should do part time jobs how they are studying because it helps them how to interact with others and knowing better the words of work besides that it helps them how to earn some money the disadvantages they will have life free time to enjoy funny moments in my opinion i think they should do part time jobs because it has more advantages advantages than disadvantages advantages
the pollution begins with fire vehicles and factories they create pollution that when it goes up to the air it transports acid particles particles in the smoke when they reach the air they are carried by wind the wind makes them reach the clouds but some of them ended up falling as dust the others that reach the clouds they mixed with cloud water and
like i said before i think you should drink a lot of water and eat a lot of vegetables and besides this you should eat as well meat it keeps your feet strong and healthy i think
once again like i said before it is important to do exercise during the day it keeps you active and there is good for your mental health as well as your physical health
there you go it depends on the person sleep eight hours some of them need to sleep less some more it depends on the person basically everyone is different
it has a huge positive effect because it gives you a lot of information about your body and what you should hate or drink and keep and maintains you aware of the interests
i live in a big house with four floors and it 's a massive house i live with my family and i share the room with my daughter which is sometimes very difficult but she 's very demanding so that 's what it is
when i 'm on holidays i love surfing and when i 'm in the beach i feel very relaxed and i think going to the beach is the best way to forget about all the problems that you have in your daily basis
i love spending time with my sister because she 's very similar to me and we spend time time talking about magazines clothes and businesses and
i am training myself to be a teacher so i 'm aimed to have that goal in the future i want to become a teacher teach economics and probably teach spanish to frame people so yeah that 's where it is
the advantages to have a job while you are studying at the university are the free time that you are going to have to spend with your colleagues so university
when you have to take a flight the first thing that you have to do is obviously to drop through the airport you can take your car you can go by bus and you can take a train when you are already in the airport you can have some coffee or have some meals in the dirty free to prepare yourself to do in the last stage the shaking why do you need to do the shaking you need to do the shaking to show your passport and to give the ticket to the woman or man who are in the front of the window to take the plane
students can use youtube videos for example to have more information about a topic they can for example use podcasts listen to podcasts while they are running while they are doing sport and that could be a very good option
i think it 's true learning face to face with a t shirt is better but it 's true that nowadays there are a lot of tools online where you can speak with a computer like i 'm doing now and it 's completely useful
they can learn how to work in a team they can learn how to be a good leader lettership is very important to work in a multinational company for example
i think breathing alone is actually very effective you can prepare yourself in a relaxed environment in your living room and for me it 's more effective than attending lectures
i think at the moment it 's very important for universities to do that because we are in a very difficult times for
i 'm so interested because i think it 's important things in our diary life
we love playing football playing basketball watching films working our dog in nature
the most similar person in my family is my mom sometimes
i would like to live in spain maybe in the north of spain
in my opinion it is a very interesting topic i agree with it it has both and the minor advantage is that it can make you feel better but you should not obsess about it
first the collect nettle from flowers bees make honey from the nettle in beehives then the beekeepers collect honey from beehives after
i think it does have importance but not as much as we think
i think the most from your health from your parents from your friends from your girlfriend is the most difficult thing
the students can learn about his food his culture his language his philosophy his weather
i agree with this i believe it can improve your life as it has improved the lives of others
i 'm interested a lot in that actually my first degree is in world economics so i 'm really interested in communicating with people from other cultures this is partially why i came to one of the most multicultural cds in the world toronto
basically my hobby is the same as my primary occupation i enjoy learning languages english is not the only foreign language that i can speak i can also speak french quite fluently and a bit of german however my german got a bit trusty over time just because of the lack of time for maintenance
well i strongly believe that the most natural and the most efficient way to improve any language is to speak to their native speakers so whenever i have the chance and the opportunity i try to communicate with as many native speakers i can encounter as possible a country where there are so many native
well it would definitely be coding because i think this is an essential skill not necessarily in software engineering but in so many other fields from linguistics to accounting to financial analysis so
well i know that many people have different approaches towards the idea of students doing part time jobs while they are studying on the one hand there are some advantages to this like learning proper time management developing interpersonal skills being able to communicate with people from different backgrounds however there are some disadvantages associated with it as well for example some students may find it hard to prioritize their studies over their part time job and they can get carried away with what they do in their part time job easily so i do n't think it is always an advantageous situation for the student to do both
so this picture represents the cycle of the acid rain in nature i wish it was a nice healthy rain but unfortunately this is not the case so essentially the way acid rain originates is that pollution is evaporated from factory chimneys and vehicles into the atmosphere here and acid particles in smoke in the form of snow smoke are carried by the wind towards the upper layers of the atmosphere and then they are carried further in different directions after which some acid particles fall out as dust and some other acid particles just mixed with cloud water
well i would definitely advise that they eat as much vegetables and fruits as possible and that they eat regularly and avoid eating just before bed or eating too much during their lunch time
i think it 's definitely very important to drink lots of water although i know some scientists start to contest this premise so essentially drinking anywhere between five to eight glasses of water per day is considered healthy and your
well i would say it is essential to do exercise at least every second day every day would be ideal but unfortunately i know it may not necessarily be feasible for everyone so time
well it depends on the person i know some friends of mine can easily cope with six hours of sleep whereas i 'm not this kind of person i need more hours of sleep eight hours is an ideal number but sometimes i sleep more
well it depends on how you look at it of course there were lots of negative effects like we were becoming more and more sedentary just because of the technology use we 're not confined to our screen at work only
so we have to take care of it
we enjoy playing golf but if weather condition is not good we will go shopping or watching movies to enjoy ourselves
my son is most similar to me although i 'm not sure if he is so happy that he is similar to me but everybody pointed out that his attitude is quite similar to me that 's very fine
if i can select wherever i want i want to live near by the sea because my hobby is fishing so i can enjoy fishing every day after retirement
it 's no doubt that fitness is very essential to keep healthy for students so the biggest concentrate on studying very much but disadvantages is students will lose the time to study but as a result my opinion is that i agree the time to make time for fitness class
from the beginning at the beginning of course bees collect nectar from flowers and farmers collect honey from bee hives and they will pack the honey into the small bottles and deliver to supermarket where we can buy the honey so
of course language in the country is key however the other and very essential factors is the safety safety is required for study
because it is a second language the speaker also takes care of their body language it 's easy for us to understand second language
in addition to the language the lifestyle and culture is also a very big handicap for students especially at the beginning of entering the country
i fully agree with that students should live alone and independently in abroad because they are away from their parents
my favorite time of year definitely is the summer because the weather is very good and you have time to spend with friends or family i especially like to play soccer and other sports
listen and read the news is very important because you have to know what is the situation in your locality city in your town in your country you have to be informed
when i was a child i really spent my first time playing whatever video game like fifa or playing soccer with my brother or spending time with my mom
actually i do n't really know but i think it could be continue with the family company because i know that i can help to improve some process like sales or something
as you know now there all university courses should include a period of practical work experience and it is very good but you know what the highest advantage of that is that it could help you to get a lot of new knowledge or new experience or something that you would be using in the future in your area of your work but there are a lot of disadvantages for example you wo n't be able to spend the time that you would like to all your friends or you would be stressed in the future so in my opinion i think it is important to all students to include a period of practical of our experience because it will help them in the future
as you know now at the age there is a lot of apps or websites that you can use to listen music online but it will be focused on three tones net that are the red one music now that are the blue one and songs for you that are the yellow now and as you can see on average actually blue one that are music now has the highest number of people listening the music per day but you can see so that the film 's net considerable will be increasing until five fifty
a good team leader have some attitudes to improve and develop the performance of the team for example leadership honestly a good communication and things like that
i do n't think there is a lot of problems if you are working in a small team spot one could be that the work wo n't be divided equitably so you can have a lot of work
i do n't think that teamwork has to be always first phase between the team members but most of the times it could be helpful because in this way you have more opportunity to speak with your members and have a good communication
yes i am completely agree with that you will achieve better results if you are in a team than if you are alone and
it is a large city river it has got one circus lots of theaters there are lots of parks in our city and very many shopping centers
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy traveling to other places meet new people and seeing new places and take lots of photos of these places
he is twelve and he is a very interesting boy it is interesting to speak with him and teach him some games
i think i will not have any new job in the future because i am old enough to start a new job but if i would have a new job i think it could be an instructor or a teacher
i think there are no advantages at all for students to get jobs to pay for their university studies because they will spend time working not studying as for me part time jobs for students is good just in a case when a student works for his future specialty so he can be more experienced and confident in his part of specialty
to travel by airplane first you need to travel to airport then you should check in and pass document control when you show your passport and security control where you show your things and goods after this you wait for your plane you can wait for some hours it depends on how early or late you arrived to the airport then you come board and after this when you take your place you can fly so your plane is taking off
students can use internet to find out information they need internet
i think it is really best when you have got a proper teacher so when you are lucky enough to have the teacher of your dream the teacher of your life it is better to study face to face with him
working as a group students can develop communication skills of course and to work as a team is a good skill for the future work too
different students have different types of learning for some students attending lectures is better but for the students attending lectures is not good they prefer read books and it is better for them than attending lectures
modern learning facilities can make lectures more interesting for students
i really enjoy visiting monuments and in general different spawn points of interest of the city and i really like to relax with my husband at the beach
i like spending time with my mom because we really like to go shopping together and do exercise where at the weekends we can do it and we spend a lot of time together
i think that students should get jobs for pay their university studies and in the case they do n't have parent support but i think that it will be better that the students only be focused on their studies because they do it to their job they could n't have enough time to study because the timetables or the job in general fits very well with their studies and i think that it will be better only they are focused in their education
first of all this journey begins with taking a manual transport a bus or a car for instance or maybe a train then you arrived at the airport and you have to do check your boarding pass on the dex with your passport and then you can find the polite on the staff security and you pass on several controls and then have to wait some a few hours while the flight arrives and then you go on board and take off
for instance the technology is a good way to learn languages because the students can practice more about their languages watching videos for instance listening to music and i think that is good
i really think that the learning face to face with the teacher is the best option because you are more confident with your teacher and
and this way helps for working in roof 's and sharing a lot
not necessary i think that attending lectures is a good option to listen to the opinions of other people but
i think that 's really important because learning facilities help us to study more and better and i think that they should provide more facilities like computers or tablets something like that
i enjoy playing tennis with my colleague you and i can reduce my stress for playing tennis and moving body is good at be health
i always with my sister and we are watching netflix together and sometimes we are going for a trip to enjoy my vacation
i would like to working as a pilot to save many people 's life because now we are suffering from covid-19 and there is a lot of vaccine i would like to send it all over the world
first of all the advantages students can know about how university will cost that makes students more concentrate to learn in the university and that is the bad thing but in my opinion that is good to get a job for the university because it will more concentrate to learn in the university
today i 'm going to talk about what people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all use public transportation to travel to the airport after arriving at the airport you may go to check in and check and finish checking after that you should pass the document control and show to the security of your baggage and after that you will wait at the gate at that time you should go to the toilet or cafe or drinking coffee or shopping then board to the airplane and take off
student can use a tablet for studying and that makes students studying everywhere anytime
i think it is very good things because if you have a question you can ask to the teacher or friends as soon as possible
on the group project students can improve communication skills at the time
yes it is true attending lectures if you have a question you can ask to teachers or friends at the time
i think that is not so important to university to introduce modern learning facility because we have a lot of books and that makes people more studying
sure i live in an apartment with three bedrooms a bathroom a living room a large table and i also live with two cats the cats belong to my sister we also have a large kitchen and a washing room
most of the time we make a picnic together we cook together too sometimes we go to a movie together and i also like to visit some friends of mine
well i love to spend time with my sister we are very alike we enjoy doing the things the same movies and we also have very similar world views about some topics like politics environment and also about art it is very funny to be with her
i would like to have two types of jobs i 'd like to be a professor at a university but also a curator at a museum at the university i 'd like to teach history of art especially contemporary art and african art
they can also build their networks and it can also influence their future but there are also disadvantages they have probably less time to study and to prepare themselves for exams and the worst thing is that they can engage less on the university activities and it can truly damage their academic prospects well in my point of view it is better for students not to work during their courses because they have to dedicate themselves through time for the university and not with a job that will probably not have any relationship with their future profession then i guess they should take a student loan or ask money for their parents this is what i think about
first of all you have to get to the airport by bus by train or with a personal car also with a taxi when you arrive at the airport you have to look for the airline company and to maybe leave your luggage there after that you 've got to look for the files to show your document then you have to wait until your flight is being called you can have a coffee go to the restroom and when your flight is being called you have to go to the gate and then enter in the airplane and finally you have to fly
they can access youtube channels they can have online books they can also download plenty of pdfs books and there are also applications
it may be best better to learn directly with a teacher but it 's not the only way of learning people can learn from the internet via skype people can also learn alone at home with books but i guess that the internet is the biggest teacher nowadays
the most important thing on working together in groups and so on is to exchange ideas and to receive feedbacks about your own ideas and also to give feedback about the idea of a colleague
i think it depends on each student we ca n't generalize such a thing some of them they like to go to attend a lecture and to get to know the teacher and to deep their relationship some other lecturers stay at home and really this is more effective
well in my point a few modern learning facilities play a very important role on the development of each student it also takes a very important influence on the future of the students because they can learn more effectively
i 'm very interested in the environment because we are devastating this world
well we like to play football we like to read books
maybe one of my brothers and maybe my son as well we are very similar
in this world
well i agree with on the other hand as it is a bandage i think it would be cost some injuries and some people 's could be exhausted after fitness class but in general i think that a healthy man and a healthy body is a good thing yes so agree and i think it 's necessary also
the first step is that bees collect nectar from flowers the second step is that bees make honey from nectar in the hives the third step is that the beekeepers collect honey from the hives it put it on crystal cans and then the fifth step is that honey is delivered to shops and the last step is when the honey is in the supermarkets
well i would like they provide me a job to earn some money for my living and a teacher i would like to dispose a teacher for me
it would open my options to find out our work abroad in other countries and my own cultural level i think is for me
the folk music the local rest days
totally agree okay they go out to other country they said they are prepared from his mother 's nest and have to make the things by themselves i totally agree
i love learning about foreign countries and about culture about their history about their politics because this is what fuels my soul actually
i do n't have that much free time but when it came i love traveling and i love to go to the museum just to cultivate myself about different things and also read on political history
the best way for me to improve my english is to watch english or american channel and also to watch some tv show in english
if it was possible i think i would like to learn how to fly but it 's not possible actually so i would like to just speak another language like chinese
one of the advantages of working as a student is to be financially independent and also to know how professional environment works and how to manage different environments but there is also backfires to this for example one of the most inconvenient things is we can be tired i mean students could be tired from their part time jobs depends on the job that they do delivery or shopper or whatever but it has to be short
acid rain is one of the most damaged phenomenon to the environment today but how this forms in the environment these particles in smoke form smoke that are sprayed in the air some of them continues their journey to mix with clouds just a reminder that clouds i met up with water and acid particles become a part of the cloud in consequence depends on the temperature rain or snow may contain a large part of particles and acid particles which is lead to acid rain or acid snow which can be really damaged to the environment
healthier lifestyle starts with nutrition and as far as i 'm concerned we must forbidden eating between meals and drink a lot of water like about one 5l per day or 2l per day whatever
our bodies are made with ninety percent of water so we should keep that level all the day because this is where our bodies take all the energy so we should drink a lot of water about two liters per day
more our life duration is so in my opinion we should keep constant the eight hours of sleeping each night and even ten hours would be perfect for an adult for example
the advantage of technology is that now we can track every aspect of our bodies and our health and we do n't have to go to the doctor all the time but the other part is we are such dependent on that
i usually enjoy spending my free time by dancing i tend to watch choreographies and learn them by watching videos and slowing them down that way i can really learn the details and dance with them with my partner
in the first place i will talk about the disadvantages and then i will talk about the disadvantages firstly the advantages i see while studying and doing part time jobs will be that they will have way more money to do things in their free time and to pay for their studying fees in the other hand we have the disadvantages one big important disadvantages would be having less time to study which could lead to having less grades and lower grades so it will be a bit more difficult
first the vehicles and factories make smoke what makes pollution then the acid particles that are in that smoke cause the acid particles carried by the wind the wine makes some acid particles fall as dust which could lead to the river and some lakes to be less clean
i would recommend to go to a nutritionist so they can tell them exactly what they need and what their body needs to have the full energy throughout the day
i do n't think we need to do exercise every day but i think it 's very important to do exercise at least two or three times a week so our body can keep up its shape and be in a healthy weight
generally technology has really improved our health because we do n't have to waste as much energy as we used to with our new technology so i think it was a very improvement
i 'm so interested because you can learn about other cultures so i think it 's positive in all her sites
maybe the best way is talking with other people of england or united states and you can learn too much about english
and maybe the italian language
some advantages that jobs while students are studying are that you maybe know the real life and you can afford and pay some things that maybe help your parents in the university and in the other hand some of these advantages are that you do n't have too much time for study and you will sleep less but in my opinion i think that you are going to learn more about responsibilities and meet other world people so definitely it 's a good form to spend your time
that picture shows us how acid rain is a product of pollution in our planet first of all factories and vehicles make acid particles that are in smoke and finally we find that particles in the clouds of the planet are carried by the wind after so so yeah it 's an important damage to the environment of our planet and we have to change that to have a better planet
maybe i think that a good habit for eating is to eat a lot of fruit five times for a day and eat some salad food two times a week
it 's too important to drinking water because sometimes we confuse about drinking water or be hungry
for a person to have a healthy lifestyle i think in my opinion that it 's too important and essential doing exercise each week because it 's a limited part of a healthy life
i think that it depends of the use of the technology that people make because you can use technology for doing very good exercise but maybe you can use technology to watch netflix so it depends
it 's very important for me because if i do n't listen and read to the news i do n't know information about it in my country
i want to be a pilot in the future so i 'm studying about the pilot but
so i think i have no idea there are disadvantages and and then you students can get more more experience so that absurdly can vary good direction to go
first of all do you see the color clearly red net blue is music now and yellow is songs for you on the first day red will start in third place and blue will start in first place place this relationship does not change until the fifth day and on the seventh day of final day rocky 's red was first blue overtaken by red was second and yellow was third
i think good team readers can talk any people so good team readers can get all people 's ideas so
for that is very good
i do n't think so recently covid-19 affected our lifestyle so we can talk to online like a zoo so i do n't think so
i 'm really interested in learning about other countries because in my opinion the world 's beauty is its diversity so discovering other cultures is the best way to open your mind about other people
i enjoy spending my free time by passing time with my family and my friends doing a lot of shopping working on myself working out and that 's it
the best way for me to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people
if i could learn a new skill it would be boxing or acting or maybe modeling and improving my skills at school
the advantages of it are that first of all students can earn some money if you 're responsible but they did n't wait pages or that it deprives students from a lot of time they can do their homework because poor time jobs take a lot of time in addition to many hours of school so that 's it
acid rain has a lot of bad effects on environment so first of all it starts from factories and vehicles because they create a lot of pollution then this pollution transforms into acid particles which are in smoke then these acid particles are carried by white and some of them fall as dust on the floor which damages the environment but other acid particles mix with cloud water and these acid particles transform into rain on snow so we call it acid rain and this acid rain is very negative for the environment
having eating habits is one of the most important things to have a healthy lifestyle first of all having eating habits permits to feel more comfortable into our body and to feel more healthy every single day and more powerful
drinking water is very necessary if you want to stay energetic all day if you want to feel hydrated and healthy you have to drink water the most that you can many times in a day
doing exercise is a way to be confident in your skin you feel powerful you feel healthy and you feel like you achieve something every time you do exercise you feel powerful
i 'm not the best to talk about sleeping because i do n't sleep a lot which is really bad you have to sleep a lot minimum eight hours in a night because you have to feel energetic for the day without what you can
so having inhabits drinking water doing exercise and sleeping are the main things to keep his lifestyle because without them you ca n't be good in your skin
i mean i 'm very interested in the environment because we have the obligation to save the environment for our health and for the health of our children
my friends and me together for example go out for the countryside to hike and
yes my family and me we are very similar for example my children the older has very similar to me and she looked to me a lot the youngest is very similar to me because he is blonde as me
in the future i think i like to live on the beach because i love the sea i love to walk on the beach and i prefer to stay there when i am retired
and this is the disadvantages we can find that the people lost a lot of time to is to do in the sportive and they do n't dedicate this time to the daily studies in my opinion maybe the school day and no to do fitness classes must be better on the weekend or one day per week almost but no for all every day it 's a good idea to dedicate to a school day to practice sports
i will speak about the honey the moment that the honey is collected is produced by this until the moment that you can find this honey in your shop these collect nectar from flowers and they go to the panel for making honey from nectar in the hippies so after that the big keepers collect honey from big hives and and
and so i think it 's very important for the people to know their second language because they improve their language and
and also have the very difficult to know to meet other people in a new country that you do n't know so there 's some of those who have friends
culture is very interesting because they improve their knowledge about a new country and also they know what is the culture in this country and how the people live there and
wow definitely i 'm quite interested to learn about new countries that 's something that i appreciate a lot
i do enjoy spending my free time in many different ways but certainly the way i enjoy to spend my free time is watching movies because i 'm addicted to the films especially those created in the 60s and 70s
throughout all those years i can say that the way to improve my english is to listening and speaking being surrounded for those kind of activities every single day surely is improving my language level
i 'm not going to hesitate answering this question definitely that skill will be to play the piano to play the piano will be a dream life for me
okay great i will enjoy to talk about this topic the part time jobs while you are studying advantages the clear advantages is despite of the money you will earn one great advantage is you will have some independence in your life and you will not depend on your parents so that is extremely important for me and a clear disadvantage is that part time jobs are not created for everyone because everyone has not the commitment to fulfill all their responsibilities between their studies between her tuitions and between her part time jobs so those students are not going to fulfill all their requirements what is my opinion everyone must be aware whether it 's in the group one or two
the acid rate is something that involves everyone in society and you know the acid rain is represented in every single season of the year it does n't matter if you are in summer winter fall autumn you will see the risks of the acid rain every day in your single life it is a cycle that involves many factors vehicles trees some plants at the end the damage to the environment is quite important and significant so at the end it destroys our nature and our lives
my most significant advice definitely would be if you mind about your health about your physical appearance and about your good looking and even more about your sexuality you should concern about your eating habits do n't eat hamburgers
to drink lots of water it 's extremely important for our health because you know we are seventy percent composed by water so like our organism is composed by water and if you do n't drink water so come on it 's something wrong
people say that just because the science has proved that eight hours is a cool average for our health by the way you should try ten twelve hours and we 'll be fine
technology has had a negative effect on people 's health
i live in a small town with my wife in a small flat but we are moving to a new flat be with them that this
when i am this holiday i enjoy travel i like to travel around the world i already visit more than thirty countries between european countries and countries all of the world
i like to spend a free time with my wife and with my parents and also with my nephews i have nine nephews and i enjoy so much the time i spend with them
in the future and more or less in no more than three years i would like to get a job as a civil servant mainly
so of the students get jobs to pay their university students the main advantage in my opinion is that the students can appreciate their parents ' effort to pay their studies and on the other hand the main disadvantage is that they ca n't focus on the students because they have to work
so if you want to travel by airplane first you should go to the airport i prefer to go by public transport and then you have to do the check in to get your boarding pass after that you have to show your document control at the security control and after that you have to wait for your flight maybe you spend one or two hours while your flight takeoff
i think that nowadays through technologies you can learn face to face with teachers
it depends and there 's only one way to learn for a group of people to be more interesting to read alone and
to provide learning facilities it 's very important for students but not all teachers can use appropriately the icts
it depends on the country but i really like to learn new things so i think i 'm really interested
i do quite a lot of things but i 'm daydreaming all the time i 'm always daydreaming when i 'm walking i also really like listening music and watching movies
i think my english is quite good except the talking part so speaking with someone native would be helpful i think
i really would love to play a piano also i really want to be good at cooking it would be helpful
besides that getting your money while studying is almost everyone 's dream and being separated from their family and is not always easy to ask money from parents so earning their money would be so helpful really boost the confidence i think those are the advantages and my final opinion is some university students should do that
ok main cause of acid rains is pollution waste products from vesicles and some factories in gas form and some acid particles from their smoke join air then are carried by the wind after that some part of these particles fall from the sky as dust while the other part is mixed with water in clouds soon this is what we called acid rain
first thing they should do is cut off junk food if they are really addicted to it they size small and aim higher than and i also think gulshan three lifestyle is better i do that
it 's quite important we need to drink water at least 3l per day and it really helps hormostasis it is great
not every day what we should do exercise regularly today is that we do n't do exercise we should walk instead we keep ourselves active
depends on the people like i need more than eight hours sleeping is really good way to reduce toxic in our brain
it has generally a good effect it is really positive we can do surgeries we keep track on our patients so
yeah i live in a very quiet city it is located in the center of my country in this case mexico
usually i enjoy in my holidays to do or make some travels and spend time with my family with my friends that they live in another countries and yeah
i think that could be my mom i have a good or a great relationship with her and also i really love spend my time with my doc my doc and her name is frida
the advantage that all students should get a cup to pay for university students i think that are about you increase your experience at the industrial or commercial field and it helps so much to endure development but this advantage that normally does n't have time to do all activities or assignments that you must do it and my opinion i think that it is good to look at a balance with those
if you 're traveling by airplane first of all you make to travel to a airport and then to do a check in with the receptionist and also you must provide your documents to a security personnel and then you board and yeah finally you board you 'll you 'll fly
and it 's important to understand the project
i think that depending on the kind of each person for me it 's better to learn alone because i think that i concentrate more but attending lectures helps so much other people
it 's very important because if you stay in a place where you feel very comfortable it 's very easy to learn and improve every day in the field that you want to improve
i have actually a deep interest in learning about other countries because i believe it 's a good way to improve and develop our knowledge
i do n't usually have so much spare time but from time to time i like to go running on the street and also at the woods and
i would love to know how to play an instrument for example piano or violin i think it 's so difficult but no pain no gain so i probably start learning about music and about the bass and
going to university is for itself a complicated decision so having a part time job could bring the same benefit at the same disadvantage at the same time first of all we are going to compare the disadvantage of having this kind of job firstly we have to know that do our homework hang with friends and have the freedom of going out and spending some time with your classmates and of course you have to study for your exams so having a part time job could waste your time and maybe you are unable to study enough on the other side having this kind of job could make you earn some money
welcome ladies and gentlemen to my presentation today we are going to talk about acid rain acid rain is a common problem nowadays and we have to find a way of eliminate it the vehicles and the factories as we all know cause pollution and this pollution usually creates acid particles that go into the smoke of these factories these acid particles could be carried by wine and could also mix in the clouds with water if this happens then acid rain is going to fall onto the ground and damage the environment as well as humans animals and the fields of farmers for example
for all those people that want to develop eating healthy habits i would say to them that they have to have a strong will power for achieving their objective but if they have a never say diatitude i 'm sure they 're going to have a healthy life
drinking water is extremely important for the human being because we are created and we are made of a high percentage of water
for my point of view doing exercise is so important in our daily life of course if we are so busy we can just sleep the exercise and do the next day but
the study shows that a human has to live at least eight hours a day so i completely agree with this affirmation because we have to be healthy also in our sleep and
it depends technology could have a bad or a good effect or an advantage or disadvantage it all depends on the way we use this technology if we are so attached to this technology we can develop an addiction and this is a really bad problem
i live in a small town that they have a lot of mountains in the near and is located in basque country near the sea if north of spain
when i 'm holiday i like to enjoy visiting different places i like non different places because i think it 's very interesting meeting different places
it 's true that it 's very important that the students should get jobs to pay for the university students because they have more possibility to independence and not depend on the parent 's economy and if they need money to pay the university it 's important that the parents help them in my opinion it 's a good idea that the different students work in and they want a lot of money to pay and that 's it thank you
now i explain about what you need to do to travel by airplane yeah then when you go to ipod you need to check in your suitcase then you need to pass to document control and you need to pass to security control then if you have more time you wait in the bar or in the cafe then you go to the airport
i think that if you read along you will more concentrated in this lecture because
i am not an environmentalist but i do want to devote more time for myself to learn more about our planet and the environment around us because i do think for human sustainability we do need to be careful about it
and we love the ones that are not thrilling or are not very hectic to go and we love to have fun together
i am most similar to my mom because she is very outgoing and friendly to everyone and to me i think this is very important because treating everyone else very friendly is they are going to giving back back to you the same thing and family to me is very important
i do n't have a city in my mind yet but i would love to travel as much as i can and right now i have n't been to europe for a while and i want to go to england and breeze and chai a lot of places and i want to experience a lot of places before i decided
the advantages of students who do the fitness class during the school day is they can have free time to practice their fitness and help them to build a healthy body and the disadvantages for them is that they may delay the time for them to study and they also may distribute their attention to the fitness classes so that they might not be interested in their academic courses anymore and
the graph is about the honey from flower to shop the first type of honey is being collected by the bees nectar from flowers the bees make honey from nectar in bee hives then the beekeepers collect honey from bee hives and add them to the bottle so after collecting honey in the bottle there will be the truck delivered to deliver the honey to the shop the final step of honey is that they will sell on the shelf
well i think that first of all the most important thing is the safety of that country after that it should be the climate of the country whether the students are suitable for it
well the benefit of that is that first of all you can really know how to speak a second language and after that in lots of second language countries the culture was so different and it 's a joy to learn another language to know their culture by that
well first of all the difficult must come from the influence by the culture because there are so many different habits of other countries people and also the difficult may be because of the language course
the first way for a student to learn about the local culture is to become friends with some local people and in that case they can take you to maybe their festivals and in that case they can learn about the culture
i agree with that kind of idea because when you study at other country it 's mostly likely that you are on your own and you have to do everything by yourself because there are no parents along with you and so in that case you can become more independent
and it 's quite good i like it
well there are a number of things that i like i think that the most thing that i enjoy might be maybe football example
well that 's a tricky question it 's difficult to answer because we are a white family but i will say that maybe my grandmother we used to watch television at night and this is a good moment for both of us because we cut up between us
and i have done psychogenontology and
i think that the main advantages is that they are going to be able to pay their students ' loans and this is going to give them a sense of responsibility but i also think that there are some disadvantages to it that is that the time that they are going to spend on those jobs they are n't going to be able to use for studying well studying is very important for having a better job in the future so it could be a downbreak in my opinion it 's a good thing having a job and not just because of the money but also because of the future prospect that the students will have about their future jobs they will have a first experience to know how it 's going to be
well it is important to arrive to the airport two hours previous to the takeoff it is also necessary to be well aware of the things that are allowed to pass through the control for example we are not able to go with metallic gadgets or any kind of wide arms a knife is impossible to pass through the security control as we have been two hours previous to the take off we are going to have quite a lot of time to wait so we can spend in the cafeteria restaurant or any kind of gift shop that they are in the airport and then it 's just waiting to the hostess to ask for us
i have experienced both sides of the boat and i would say that maybe the face to face learning or school is better than the one online so it 's more comfortable
many things
it really depends on the person but many people yes by reading something can catch everything so it really depends on the personal preference and the abilities
i 'm very interested because it 's very important for everyone
i like to go swimming or ride a bike or sometimes go to run and spend time with my family
i think that is my father
i think that it is very important that students do a fifth class because it is healthy for students and can i think that they have to continue and
well the tips for do honey is first bees collect nectar from the flowers then the bees fly to the beehives and they make honey from the nectar then it is put into glasses and then some people carry it to the different places to sell it
i think that the principal thing that they have to consider is the prices or the coins that it 's going to use and where they are going to live is very important
i think that it is very important because it can open some doors and opportunities for the students if the students can speak two or maybe three languages for their professions
it is really difficult because way of their houses they have to live a new kind of life and it 's very difficult
now i 'm living in an apartment with two bedrooms and with one of my colleagues it 's very convenient and you know the site is very good at there because it 's fifteen floors
well in holiday i like to stay with my colleagues going on site together visiting some museum or you know a heritage site as well
currently i do n't have a clear view about my future i hope i can take a job that requires lots of time but can have a very high salary
well from where the advantages of university students taking a job to offer their payment of university fees first of all they can get more familiar with the working environment after the graduation which will benefit for the job seeking or even the career development so from my opinion the university students should take part time jobs under the regulation of the university to guarantee the study time and yeah
the diagram shows the procedure of traveling by airplane first of all you need to travel to the airport you can choose any kind of transportation like your private car or train or bus to arrive at the airport then and then you have to hand out the document to the security to pass the security check and wait until the boarding time to you know get on the plane
there are several ways for students to use technologies in their study the most important one is the search engine like google they can search the materials that they want of any kind from the internet and use them
well i agree with this idea
well in the group project the most important thing they can obtain is the group cooperation with other people which will be very important in the working environment because most of us we are working a company
yes i think attending a lecture is very important because if you study alone it 's a big challenge to your self discipline but if you attend a lecture the teacher will control your study and
well i think the learning facilities is very important in the university
i think that the environment is very important for our lives because without environment there is n't life
i love my family
i am happy to talk about this topic because for me it 's very important the fitnet clashes because they are very important for a healthy life because school and schools and college should make time in the school day for all the students to do business classes in my opinion is very important to do fitness classes because you will be strong and more intelligent
i go to speak about honey from flower to salt the bees collect nectar from flowers next bees make honey from nectar in behaviors with lighter big keepers collect honey from beehives and put the honey in bottles next the bee keepers put the bottles in the vehicle and
i think that is very important studying in another country because you will learn their language and their culture
i think that the more difficulty of studying in another country is learning other languages
when you study in other country you learn a local culture and
living in another country it will the person be more independent
i 'm deeply interested in learning about other countries and my two favorite things to learn about them is try its foot and also learn something worse from their language
i really enjoyed relaxing in my house so i spent my free time here in my house watching movies or some tv shows and eating popcorns or drinking coffee or something like that
i think that the best way to improve my english is through immersion i mean going to a country where english is spoken but the second best way to learn about english is watching tv shows in english and listening to music in english
i think that it will be cooking i mean right now i do n't enjoy it because i think that i do n't know how to do it correctly and
okay i find some advantages in working as a student at the same time some of them are that you can practice what you learn in schools when you are working so you gain experience in the area and you also start to know people who 's working in this area and you can build some networking in the field i also think that it has disadvantages because working on a study requires time and it 's a huge responsibility which could be so stressful at the end i think that it is very useful and students should do part time jobs while they are studying because at the end it has a positive impact in their experience and it could help you to find a job
today we 're going to talk about acid rain acid rain is caused by pollution this pollution is principally emitted by factories and vehicles and we 're talking about smoke this smoke has some acid particles and these acid particles are carried by wine in this acid rain is toxic so it has severe damages to our environment because not only damage or plants but also microorganisms in or solid
my advice to these people is that they plan their meals it will help you to be prepared when you have hungry and not fall in this junk food that you can find in the streets
it 's difficult to determine how much is a lot but the recommendation is that you should bring at least two liters of water every day that 's what our body needs to maintain a hydration
absolutely in my opinion it 's vital to do exercise every day the recommendation is to do at least thirty minutes of exercise this can improve our health in a good way
i think that each body is different someone can just need six hours of sleeping and another body can need nine hours of sleeping
i think that it can have both for one side we can have all these apps and programs that are useful to track or habits of exercise or eating but
i 'm interested in learning about other countries so much because i think learning more about others countries can have a deeper insight into other cultures and broaden my horizons
i enjoy spending my free time by reading books watching movies watching drama series and have an out with my friends
as for improving my oral english i think it is better to speak as much as possible with your foreign friends and read as much as possible too
i think it could be a cooking because cooking is an important skill for an independent life and through cooking i can make delicious meals for my families to spread happiness and well being
so i think the advantages are students can gain more practical skills and combine what they have learned in their textbooks with their experiences through doing part time jobs but the disadvantages are that they may be easily distracted from class and leading to their poor grades so i think it is better to strike a balance between doing part time jobs and studying and students should make the most appropriate part time jobs for themselves because part time jobs vary from person to person and they should choose their individual jobs
pushing given off from factories and the vehicles contains smoke which acid particles are in and they are carried by the wind some of them fall as dust and others mix with cloud water to form rain or snow which is also called acid rain and and acid rain can do harm to the environment which has raised people 's awareness of it
i think it is persistence and self discipline by
i 'm in favor of it enough sleep can refresh your mind after a busy day and get you well prepared for the next day but sleeping deprivation can make you stressed next day
i 'm very interested in other countries because i really like other cultures and i like visiting them also i think that this is very important for you
in my free time sometimes i go to the park and see the birds of the sky i really like relax
this is a controversial question because i think that exists a lot of methods for learning english but
maybe if i can learn one skill this should be learned a lot of languages because i really like other languages
i think that this is a controversial topic because it has a lot of advantage and also it has this advantage for example you can make money if you work while you are studying but you spend a lot of time and this time you should spend a study if you want past the exam of the university for the reason i think that it 's better if you do n't work while you are studying but if you need the money you should work
i 'm going to talk about acid rain in this picture we can see the water cycle first next of all we can see like factories and vehicles made pollution and this pollution is in there and next we can see the acid particles are smoke and acid particles are carried by wind
if you want eating good habits i think that you need to cook your food
i think that it 's very important that you drink a lot of water because your body is format for eighty percent of water and you need this for live well
i think that it 's not necessary doing exercise every day of the week but if you want to stay good with your body i recommend you that you do two times a week exercise
i think that it 's very important that you sleep very well and eat horse for a day but if you ca n't one day it 's not important
it 's a controversial topic because in general i think that the technology is a good invention but it 's true that the technology produces a lot of stress in a lot of people
it 's well known that the environment needs to be healthy for our future and keep the nature in a healthy way and try to stop the pollution and contamination of the environment
my friends and me would like to spend the time going to the cinema going to restaurants all the time when i hosted a dinner for them and we start to talk about our families our goals and catch up with them
in my point of view they 're more similar as me and my mother because she has the same love for music classic music and orchestral music so we sometimes spend time to listen to the kind of music that we enjoy too much
in the future i see myself living in the wild because it 's a lovely city with amazing structures and amazing people amazing music it has always been my dream to live there
in other words it is very important to know the advantages and disadvantages about the exercises for example in one hand i can mention one advantage of the fitness classes would be that the system of schools and colleges teach students how to start a healthy life and include it in their routines in other hand one of the disadvantages would be that time they are spending on fitness classes it would be used for breathing day brain
hello good morning today i 'm going to explain you how honey is produced first of all every start with bees bees collect nectar from flowers and cycling the bees make honey for nectar in beehives third the big keepers collect that honey from behaviors and keep that honey into the good designed honey bottles that honey bottles are organized and then distributed for the company the company provides this honey to supermarkets small shops thank you
in my opinion the advantages of studying the second languages will be that you can improve that language so that you can learn more about the language start to talk with the other people and get good curriculum for that
in my experience the most difficult to study in other countries is you are so far from your family you it
in my experience the best way to know more about the local culture is to integrate of the festivities and working around the city go to the small markets so you can get more interesting about the local culture
so now i would say that it really helps to become independent because be far away of your parents teach you how to keep a home how to cook how to make money and other skills
in the holiday i like reading books because
i do n't understand can you repeat the question please
because if they are working they wo n't study good in they are studying every day of the moment because it is the future
to go ipod you should take card the booth or the tray often you should go to check in your street case after you have to submit your documentation to the security you will have to wait and finally you will get on the plane often you so go to the cheek in your sweet case after you have to submit your documentation to the security you will have to wait and finally you will get on the plane on the site are allxxx
i am not sure but i think the students have to use the technology because it 's very important for the students
i think it 's very important to learn facility learning at the moment because it is important down for students
today the pollution is very bad because there are a lot of cats and sheeps in the world and biomania is more important to the earth and i care our planet
when i meet with my friends i like watching movies i 'm going to the cinema and
my father is similar to me because he likes football and a lot of sports with me like tennis and paddle he is tall with me and he is my family
in the future out of europe for example i would like to london or england because here is so beautiful and i learned other languages our english
the advantage to do fitness classes is to meet other people while you do sports and the second advantage is to practice other sports that you do n't know and if you practice fitness classes this sport helped you to concentrate to study and i do n't found nothing disadvantage in my opinion to do sport in classes is very important to study in schools or colleges
i am going to explain how honey is produced the first bees collect nectar from flowers then bees make honey from nectar in behaviors and then beekeepers collect honey from behaviors than they arrive at supermarkets
i think that students choosing another country because they have learned the language before and in the future they will meet other people
i think that found difficult to study in another country when they do not know this language before it 's difficult studying a second language
i agree with you because the study is becoming independent when they live in another country and he or she be able to independent when he cooking or cleaning the flat
i 'm interested in their countries and their cultures but mainly in their language
i like to spend my free time playing soccer watching many series and movies but what i like to do the most is think it is what i love the most and i could do it all the time
i like to watch movies or read a lot in english but i think the best way is speaking with another person and practice practice all the time and this is the key be better
i would like to learn to play any instrument as i said a few moments ago i like to sing and that come in with any instrument and i think it could be amazing for me
in my opinion i think it 's option a great idea only if you have the time and the school allows it because these activities are very difficult i think the part time jobs have a lot of advantage and maybe you have enough money to go out with your friends go to the parties and go to the movies or cinemas and maybe you can pay your gym but and these have a lot of disadvantage because you do n't have enough time to do your homework to pay attention of your classes and you do n't have the time to study for your exams i think it 's very difficult
acid rain humans six steps happen two acid particles are in the smoke and then these particles goes to the sky and in the third pass third step acid particles are carried by wind for some acid particles fall as dust number five other acid particles mix with cloud water and then the final step six acid particles are in rain or snow and this damage them to environment
in addition to hydrating you we need water because our body needs a lot of water to perform various functions for example blood contains a lot of water and that water carries oxygen throughout our body to the cells
not every day but it 's very important that you do a lot of exercise because it 's healthy and your body needs this exercise to be healthy and that 's all
but if you sleep a little more it will not affect much everybody is different but sleeping eight hours will surely help your health
as everything has it good and bad things unfortunately now the negative side is affecting us but if you know how to use technology it can help you to be healthier you can watch videos or even apps will help you have a healthy life
it 's a beautiful place there are a park and near there are schools and beautiful lakes with birds
in holidays i enjoy going to the beach and going to parties with my friends i love to travel and meet new people
i would be a broker to seth 's house and i want to be rich in my future and page
in my opinion an advantage that could have work is that you can pay your own things you can buy clothes you can buy eats you can buy everything that you want if you own half a job your parents should pay you everything and i think that if you want to be a good person you must be independent from your parents i work since i have twelve years old and in my opinion it is very important work
okay when you travel by airplane you have to know that you must go to the airport in car auto use or train after to arrive to the airport you must know that in have to do a checking after the checking you pass a control by a police and you must have your document and
i think that the students can use their new technologies to study best using mobile phones because they can consult everything in his mobile app
work in group projects can be a good solution to do the best things every people can learn you to do new things and
in my opinion noise is bad because you do n't focus in the text i prefer read my own paragraph and try to think how are the texts
to the university have to try that every student learn well and do his course well
for example i 'm very curious about the environmental problem so to make the sustain of the world is a basic problem for us so it is very important
my brother is most similar to me he has two common points with me he is gentle and make a joke often in daily lives but he is not good at studying
i agree with the school and the college should make time to school day for our student to do fitness classes there is twelve reasons so if they do not exercise they will get on weight and will become sick in the future but they can concentrate on studying for a short time so it is good for a school to take a fitness class
hi first bees collect nectar from flowers and that is bring back to their nest and in their nest there are a lot of honey in the nest and second beekeepers collect honey from the bee hive it is a dangerous work but it 's essential for the honey company and then in the factory honey was put into the bottle and that is sending to the truck and truck transports the bottle to the store at any place and
when students choose a country to study abroad plus they should think about how to study and what is the aim of study so to think about that they can choose the country that is the best for study
so another country has another culture so they have difficulty in understanding with each other and other students
so they can communicate with a lot of people in another country
it 's not difficult to become independent so that is the aim of them
of course i live in a flat near to the coast and we have the sea in at five minutes approximately we live in a flat with another native oars
i enjoy visiting other museums monuments and
i enjoy spending time with my granddad because when i was a child i go with him everywhere

well there are many advantages but also there are disadvantages for example the advantages are the students who work and know the effort that do pay their universities and this is a positive point and disadvantages for example is that they ca n't dedicate all the time to study and the marks can be worst in my opinion it depends on the person for example a person it 's good but no another person it 's bad i think this
well traveling by plane travel to the airport you can go by bus by car or by train and then when you are in the airport checking you have to give your passport and an assistant staff and make them make the issue then you have to go to the document control then the security wait for the plane because it is recommended to stay two hours after the the depart and then when the informations take you have to board in the plane
nowadays we have technology to support our studies and
well in fact there are many positive things
i think attending lectures is better because you have another opinion you can ask for some tabs and you 'll have different options instead
well nowadays we are living the media age and i think it 's possible to have a lot of forms to improve and learn things about the university
my favorite time of year was summer i there are a lot of sun the weather is warm and i like it
it is important to me to read and listen to the news but sometimes the news is not good because there are a lot of problems in the world or a lot of bad news so i prefer to not read and listen to the news
when i was a child i spent my free time with my friends in the park we played some games and we played with other children in the park
i hope to do in the future i work in a big company and i work with a lot of people in a business company in the area of the business administration
well i think it is important that all the university courses should include a period of practical work experience because there are a lot of advantages like you improve in your personal life and in your personal job in my opinion there are no disadvantages for this or well maybe you do n't have more free time or to do other things and well in my own opinion i think it is important to the students take practical works experience during the courses of university
well this line graph shows the visit to the three new online pop music site about last week during their first week as you can see the tonnage net is increasing dramatically to day seven to then the songs for you is not very popular so
and that is good for the team
well it 's not necessary to the team boards have face to face teams i recommend to do two face to face teams because it 's more efficient with the people see each other in person and
well i live in galicia and now i am living in salamanca
well when i am in holiday i like to spend my time for example a go go to the beach and also a go running also a dinner at the good restaurants so
well i like spending my time with my mom or with my grandmother because i love spending time with her with his she told me a history when she was young and it 's very funny
well in the future or i would like to be a teacher with my own school i like the children and i like the school
well nowadays it 's very common that students should get jobs to pay for the university studies but it is difficult because these have advantages and disadvantages for example one advantage could be they have money to shop their own things and they can spend the money in her things but have a disadvantage also for example they have to combine the job and the study and now and in some cases or it 's very difficult to combine this also they have n't any free time and so it 's difficult for a young person and and
yeah i agree with you
yeah i think attending lectures is better than reading alone because you can learn the mistakes of another person and you also practice your pronunciation and you learn to read good
firstly the other culture is the important part to interest me secondly i will make new friends in other countries
when i 'm free i often play computer games with my classmates it 's a very interesting thing when i play them i will feel excited and forget any troubles
i hope liuyin is the south of china because it has developed the economy and the culture is very freedom the environment is also good to liuyin

hello everyone today my presentation topic is about how honey is produced and i will show everyone a degree firstly you can see the bees will collect nectar from flowers and they will take them to their house if we can call it beehives the and and we can buy the honey in the supermarket it is usually a delicious thing i think
when students consider sourcing a country they should consider the culture of the country because the culture is a very important point
studying a second language can help people to take friends with other countries people and they also can discuss complex questions with their professor
firstly they will feel it is difficult to make friends with other countries ' people because of the difference in culture
i agree that because the students learn in the other country they need to do things by themselves
i am super interested in learning about other countries because it 's very necessary in our life have knowledge about other cultures
i like to gather with my friends and drink some beers or maybe go to concerts with them and i really love read too
the best way for me is listening to some videos cartoons or music and try to think in english
i like to sew because it permits me to fabricate my own clothes so it 's really funny
i think that the life of the students is very funny because normally they met new people and they are very younger so they love barry it but in my opinion i think that the two things are good but always in balance
the acid drain is provoked by the factories and vehicles that spur the pollution to the air then the acid particles are in smoke and they are blown to many parts of the atmosphere then the acid particles are carried by queen and some acid particles fall as dust and they come to the earth other particles acid particles means with cold water and then the acid particles and in rain or snow and then they pull in the fields and damage to the two environment
i advise them to eat a lot of proteins and follow a mediterranean diet because it 's the best of the health and it 's necessary of our health
i do n't think that it 's necessary doing exercise every day but for example do it three times per week is good and work also
i think that sleep is super important for our body and have a good habits and sleep eight hours per night is sufficient
it depends on the use of technology in many cases it 's good for our health because it helps us but
it 's very very good
is my opinion you
to travel to buy plane first you go to the airport and check in and you must have a document control and secure it and you ca n't wait when you 're waiting in the airport when the alien is in i thought it is very very important that you have a document contract because it is necessary
the technology is very very important for the students because now in these times everybody body use the technology for look for questions
i think it is very good because the students they are asked all the questions that they are n't now in this moment
my favorite time is autumn because autumn is a very comfortable season in this season it 's not very hot or very cold and the fruit is very delicious in autumn
i think read news every day is very important we need to understand what happens in our surroundings every day and it 's the most important thing that we can prepare everything in advance
when i was child i would n't have many work or study i just need to have fun
my master 's degree is environment management so maybe in the future i will choose a job about my major and i think environment is very important in our daily life and this career is very useful
i think this topic both have advantages and disadvantages speaking for advantages maybe university students can get more work experience through their practice work classes but students did n't have too much time to work in the university because students in the university maybe the most important task is studying they need to focus on their courses to get more professional knowledge about their major so maybe sometimes they ca n't balance the time of study and working so in my opinion i think maybe some university courses can include some practice work experience but not all of them
this graph gives some information about the numbers of people visiting the set during their first week online there are three online pop music sets the red one is turn 's night and the blue one is music now the yellow one sounds for you and in this diagram we can see that the red one turns night is increased in this seven day and the blue and yellow one that music now and the songs for you is reduced in this four day and and
i think the most important factor is to have patience because we need to cooperation with everyone in this team so we need to have patience to work with others and listen to others ' requests and ask their questions
i think in a small team maybe we do n't have many persons we can talk so maybe we ca n't create many interesting ideas or listen to other opinions it 's very disadvantageous in a small team
yes maybe face to face is more effective than online meeting so maybe online is more effective than the face to face form
maybe teamwork has better results than working alone because in a team we have many people so maybe sometimes we can get more information and create an interesting idea in a team and
well if i have to be honest i have to say that i 'm not really interested in the environment that 's probably due to the fact that i 'm afraid of all the animals and so i 'm not really correlated to that kind of thing so
we are really into hanging out but also we absolutely love staying at home and watching movies or tv series while eating some pizza and drinking beers or coca cola
that 's a nice question i mean i can not decide which person of my family is more similar to me that 's probably due to the fact that i 'm similar from different aspects to different persons in my family
doing some sport at school in italy every school have at least one hour of gym at school obviously the advantages are related to our healthy and these advantages are correlated to the fact that some people could agree that that sport is n't as important as culture math and so on as far as i 'm concerned it 's important to have some sport class at school because it also helps for students to wind down their mind so to stop thinking for at least one hour and to relax more even if sport is n't relaxed at all
and after being produced honey is being transported in the supermarket and the outlet to be sold
for made up their mind about the country where to go they should consider the fact that they have to speak with other people in that country so they have to learn that language and also maybe to attend a course to learn that language better
well there are plenty of cons on knowing another language first of all it could be really useful for your future working life in fact for example it is really a surplus when you know another language in a cv
well there are a great amount of difficulties that students can find for example the fact that you have to talk with other people so at the beginning it will be really difficult to understand them and to approach with them
well i 'd say that the best way is to interact with people from that country obviously spending time with them can help you to learn their habits and also about their country also their eating habits that
i 'd say so yeah absolutely living in another country will help you to become much more independent because you can not count on your family and you will have to do everything alone
i 'm very interested because you can learn about the cultures and how people are excuse me and i think it 's important
in my free time i like to do some exercise i like watching tv shows listening to music or maybe reading books because i love it
well i reckon that the advantage would be that you can earn money and you can pay your studies you can develop some skills that would help you in the future and maybe you can put it that works in on cv maybe the disadvantage would be that you can spend your time studying i mean you have less time to study or doing homework and well i think that it could be a good idea work but
and because of that many particles and toxins are liberated to the atmosphere and this is too bad for the environment because some of these particles and toxins mix with cloud water or some of others and others can fall as dust but those that mix with cloud water then fall in rain and
first of all you need to know that this is good for you and think about like a fun activity after
because our body is made of water and we need to drink water for our cells and this is good because we feel more healthier
negative effect because this is something stressful for us and make that anyone moves and go out to the street
very much interested in learning other countries cultures after graduating high school in japan i moved to the uk spent one year then and went to irish university for four years now i 'm in the us so i learned a lot about different cultures
i spend most of my free time with my family i 've got a son and daughter and so i spend most of my time with them playing drawing chatting watching tv together playing game together them
when i was in japan and did not have many opportunities to speak the best way to do is shadowing and listening to the radio and speak after that important
i 'd like to learn how to cut and cook fishes because now i started fishing as a new hobby and if you can cut and cook fishes and it 's great
i do not agree with the statement that all university students should do some part time jobs there 's an advantage of doing a part time job as a student obviously you can learn how to earn money and obviously as a student you need to spend a lot of money on tuition fees and your daily lives but on the other hand you have to balance your time you have to study in the library if you 're a student the main thing you 've got to do is studying so if enough money and your focus is on studying a subject you do not have to do so this is the reason why i do not agree with the sentence
so here 's how acid rain is caused and eventually damaged environment first of all acid particles are created by emission of pollution from factories and vehicles and any other services and then acyparticles as the smoke go up in the air and within that air acyparticles are carried by wind and it forms cloud some acid directly it falls to the ground and damage the soils or ponds some rubber ocean
i think a good eating habit is eating breakfast lunch and dinner at the same time every day and not eating too many sweets and alcohols
i would say it is extremely important to drink water regularly instead of drinking only coffees or alcohol and sugary beverages because it dehydrates your body
it 's not essential to do exercises every single day but it is important to do some exercise it depends on your age your gender and what level of healthiness you are looking for but certainly doing an exercise is good for your health
i do not necessarily agree that every single person needs eight hours of sleep every day on average it would be good to have eight hours of sleep but again depending on a person you may only need six hours of sleep
i see environment as a pretty serious issue because nowadays people tend to create a lot of waste so normally when i go out i bring my own own container for food etc
me and my friends enjoying going for window shopping finding nice dining restaurants for supper as well as go to a cinema to enjoy a movie
and my family i 'm most similar to my mother and she is the one who always takes care of me and pays all my tuition fees for the school and she always took me out when she has some event
i 'm currently living in taipei because of the work i used to do here and
there are some pros and cons if scores and colleges make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes the negative parts the disadvantages are the students may get too tired after the exercise and they will become very sweaty in the way that the classroom will fill with bad snows on the other hand the advantages are the students may be able to feet keep fit and to be more able to focus on what they are learning because there 's a study saying that exercise can help people to get focused and they will become effective learners so
today 's presentation is about how honey is produced there are six steps of it and it 's from the flower to shop so first of all the bees have to collect nectar from the flowers after that they will make honey from nectar and beehives after making the honey the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then put it into the jar after that the jars will be shipped to the supermarkets or the stores that sells the honey and in the end the customers will get the honey from the supermarket
when choosing a country to study in students should consider about the culture first whether it suits their preferences and secondly it 's
students may find it difficult about the culture when they study in another country because different countries have different cultures it might be extremely opposite from their home country so they need time to adapt
students can learn about the local culture by making some local friends in the country like this they can all hang out together in a way that they can experience the local culture
i think studying abroad indeed helps students to become more independent as for me i used to study abroad for a year and that makes me more important because i have to do everything on my own including cooking thing
i love learning about new countries and languages and cultures because i think that the more you know about new societies different societies and ways of thinking the better person you can become
i used to have a dog and then i used to love taking him to parks or for walks nowadays he passed away and nowadays i like to read and watch tv series and movies
practicing especially with a demanding teacher who corrects me all the time and helps me improve my pronunciation and grammar and going to school and and studying
it would be dancing because i think it 's a great job it 's relaxing and it would also improve my self confidence
all university students should part time jobs while they 're studying in my opinion it should be optional for the students because on the one hand the ones who do n't work would have the opportunity to check how real life works and put into practice the theory the learning class on the other hand for those who already worked for self support or to support their families it would be a great disadvantage because they would n't be able to leave their real jobs and look for something that may not be rewarding in question of money i 've been through this situation and it was really exhausting most teachers do n't understand that you do have to work to support yourself and
all the pollution caused by vehicles and factories are the ones that cause the acid to rain and so the government should be more demanding with factories in order to avoid this problem
first of all i think people should cut down on sugar salt and processed food and as a vegetarian i would also suggest people to reduce or cut totally down as much as bread meat as possible
it is extremely important as long as you respect your body remember two liters may be too much for a person who weighs fifty kilos but be too little for a person who weighs one hundred kilos so you should always talk to a doctor
i think it is essential to do exercise and the question about every day depends on a person 's habits
well i personally disagree because i need nine hours of sleep but some people do well alone seven hours sleep
this is a tricky question because it depends on how people deal with technology on the one hand it can be good because you can research about good better ways of life but on the other hand it can be bad because people are spending too much time in front of screen
currently i live in london which is the largest city in the united kingdom it is a very beautiful bird it 's really noisy as well
when i 'm on holiday i like to practice my hobbies
i really enjoy spending time with my sister she is younger than me and she is amazing she is not only very funny she is also very intelligent and very amazing
however when i moved to london i realized how much i love fashion
so basically i strongly believe that to get job to earn some money to invest on pay you to university is a very good idea the advantage is that you are going to be independent of your parents and the disadvantages will be that you wo n't have lot of time to have a great time to your friend and also maybe you wo n't have a lot of time to study however my opinion is that if you want to get a very good future you need to do that so i strongly believe that it is a very good idea
basically first of all you need to arrive to the airport so you must take a car bus or train the best option is a train because it 's very fast in addition when you arrive to the airport you need to do the check in so you must wear your passport with you then you need to go to the document control and you need to show your passport and your ticket then you need to pass for the security control and then you need to wait until the hour of the department but then you need to go abroad and then the plan is going to run off
when students are working on group projects together they are learning to be good on team work which is a very important skill
i live in a village it 's a rural village and it 's surrounded by beautiful landscapes and stunning views it 's quite breathtaking
in holiday i like travel to different countries to discover and explore a foreign culture because i 'm an open minded person
i like to spend my free time with my sister because she is the same age as me and we like to enjoy different afternoons playing football in the garden
in the future i would like to have a job relationship with my degree as an engineer of industrial technology
in my opinion i strongly believe that not all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies because there are some students that can afford their university studies but for example there the main advantage is air mourning but the main drop work is the time that waste for working as their job
this diagram shows the stage people need to go through to travel by airplane before landing you must check in your document control and you will pass the security control next you have some time to wait in the airport doing some shopping or going to a toilet or a coffee center when it 's a time you board to the plane and next finally you land it
yes i reckon that face to face is the best way to learn but nowadays technology improves follow students to study with online
in my opinion i do n't think that attending lectures is better than reading alone because reading alone you improve yourself
it 's so important for university learning facilities because the students in the university have some of them part term jobs and they do n't have enough time to go to a classroom
the place where i live cos murcia is a region in the south of spain can visit
on my holiday
definitely my father is the first person to be your free time and spend your time because it 's so funny it 's so exciting to be with him
in the future i like to be a professor in the great university of spain because i like the chemistry and i studied chemistry and it 's going to be a dream to be a professor of chemistry
nowadays half a part time job when you are studying in university is more frequently these have advantages and disadvantages part of these advantages is the experience of being part of a team work and but some disadvantages is the complicate but that is complicated to coordinate the university 's duties and the part time job and my opinion this is so important and you need to be this one
well travel is one of the best things i want to do first you have to go to the airport this is so important be in time so you have to choose the best option to arrive at it
nowadays technology is more important in life this is the very key to improve your knowledge
my opinion is the best way to improve your knowledge and have a teacher face to face
always can learn about others and
i prefer reading alone in my opinion but other people prefer attending lectures because it 's the way to concentrate it and it 's more effective for the time
in my free time i like watching tv playing with my son doing sport but my favorite hobby is photography i love photography i
in my opinion the best way for improve my english is speaking with english people or watching a movie or tv in english i
i would like a play the guitar or any instrument i think it 's very beautiful
this is a very interesting topic personally i think the advantages are the students will be more responsible and they will learn a job and the disembodied teams i think the study have less time for study but in my opinion i think the other things have more advantages than disadvantages
i go to speak about atheroid first of all the fast story are working on the pollution up a lot the acid particulate and the smoke and this acid particulate are carried by the wind
the best way for eating healthy is to eat fresh food
i think the people have a drink eight water glass all day okay two liters
think it 's necessary to exercise every day i think it 's better to choose a week
from opinion of view i think that 's great speed sleep eight hours a day
and it for me is more important it of the countries
so i enjoy spending my free time in the cinema for example with my friends or go to the beach with my family or working with my dogs
i think that the best way to improve my english is go to the other country where we 're speaking english and pass a long time and work in this country
i go learn i do n't know i i think i 'm very happy if i can fly and
for one advantage is that the students can win money and it is a best part for you can spell the money in geometrical of the university or in other course or other things for
acid rains be to form when moisture in the air combines with acid particles emitted by factories and vehicles after the acid particles are carried by the wind and other other particles mix with cold water and precipate in rain or snowfall it depends and this act damage much the true environment because the pollutant is particles it 's very really bad and corrosive for the whole planet
in my opinion having good eating habits it 's very important to improve your health
i think that doing water is very important because the water stills for clean your body and the experts recommend doing two liters for dye
in my opinion exercising is essential to have a good quality of life it may not be necessary to practice it every day although if you have the time and desire that is fine
i believe that children have to sleep more than adults but for a teenager or an adult it is appropriate to sleep eight hours a day true
i think it has its pros and cons but for me the advantages are more important since thanks to technology great advance have been made for history and help us improve our quality of life continue
yes i love the environment so much where and i can find many students working around the campus and
me and my friends enjoyed doing watching movies together so that we can discuss about the heroes and heroines and we can talk about the scenes in the movies and
i am most similar to my third older sister because our height is about the same and also our appearance is about the same where we wear glasses and
in the future i would like to live in the urban area because in the urban area there are less air pollution because there are lesser cars and transportation and in the urban area they are more peaceful and they are more quiet
fitness classes in school day may bring advantages or disadvantages to the students and then there are the other advantages advantage for students joining the fitness class is that they may learn the different exercises in the fitness classes however there are some disadvantages where the students may not focus in their class and then they will cost them have lesser time to do their study
the diagrams shows how the honey is produced from the flower to shop first the bees will collect the nectar from the flowers and then the bees will make the honey that they collected from nectar in their bee hives after that the bee keepers will collect the honey from the bee hives and then the honey will be produced and processed and packaged into the packaging which normally will be a bottle after the honey is well packaged the honey will be sent or delivered to the shop and
when the students choosing a country for studying they must consider about the cost of learning and also the cost of living as well because if the cost of living is very expensive their parents may not afford to pay for it
the advantage of studying in the second language is that when the students may have more advantage to get a new job in the future because they know more than one language
studying in another country i think that the students may face some difficulties such as they may not able to communicate well with the local people because of the language and
when the student is studying in another country i think the students can learn the local culture by joining the activities of the local people and
yes i agree that student studying abroad can become independent because when they are in another country they may have to adapt to the environment themselves and if they have any troubles they have to solve on their own
my favorite time of the year is the winter because i like to feel the cold in my face and i love the winter clothes
i like to be informed of what is happening around me that 's why i use to watch the news every day i think it 's very important to know how your country is doing
i come from a large family so i used to spend my free time playing with my brothers and sisters on a weekend we used to go to our house in the village
in the future i would like to have an out money to travel with my family around the world i would love to visit a different country every year
starting work before you finish your studies is an opportunity to improve your skills and to be in contact with the real world working maybe bad for you because you spend your time working even studying in my opinion it 's a very good idea because i think it 's important to be in contact with the labor world
at the pictures we can see the progress of three new live pop music sites we can see that music now has rising since the first day till the third day but
sometimes it 's good to be in this accordion because you can improve your ideas and maybe it makes you to be better
it 's possible that there are people who do n't like works on team and
i 'm very interested about learning other countries and i try to know more about them
well i enjoy going for a walk with my family watching movies especially serials i like studying english practicing it in different ways
the best way for me to improve my english is practicing speaking with somebody watching movies and reading
if you mean a new skill it is something absolutely new for me i would try a new kind of sport
well advantages for university students when they do part time jobs are obvious students study how to communicate with other people how to work in teams for example also they have pocket money maybe not pocket and they are able to pay back their student loan there are also some disadvantages although these are an ability to have much free time for entertainment difficulties to find enough time to study and maybe tiredness my own opinion it 's very good when students can work
there is a big problem for our nature with acid rays there is a natural cycle of making this phenomenon vehicles and factories and also plants and other means of transport they make a lot of fumes which goes to atmosphere they form pollutions which consist from acid particles with the smoke acid particles go into the atmosphere by the wind and some of them are going down at the ground as a dust rain or snow other
i would recommend to eat more fruits and vegetables and also food rich of carbohydrates and proteins all food should be fresh
i think that drinking lots of water is very important for everybody because our body consists mainly from water and all processes in our body are unable to be without water
i think it 's essential to do exercises every day because in this way a person can keep their feet and be in a good station
well i agree with the opinion that people have to sleep at least eight hours a day not less but maybe somebody needs more sleeping and
technology may give positive and negative effects and it depends on different circumstances when finding the information is an important thing it 's preferable to use a computer but it 's not too much
it 's a beautiful city surrounded by mountains and the ocean on the other side i can see the sunset and the sunrise every day from my home i feel like i 'm really lucky to live in this place almost all the year is sunny and very nice
i love to check and see new places i love to go around and do the bicycle hiking running around the parks and look into the nature with my family
i like to have a job where i can use all my capacities and skills i would prefer a job or in an office where i can sit from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon so after that i could have some quality time with my family doing things together and maybe eat them put together
we 're going to talk about if the students should get jobs while they are doing their university studies we know that everybody is going to get jobs because of the money the money is always good to have but considering that the time you have to invest for working is the time you will take out from the university classes and i think you should be focusing especially when you are at school where you have a lot of more freedom in what is important what is important in that time is that you have to sit and listen to your teachers and learn and go deep in research investigate not only focusing in the money in that short period of time
hello today i 'm going to teach you how to travel by an airplane to be able to take an airplane first you need to take transportation to get to the place called airport the airport is the place where the airplanes go out when you are at the airport you need to go and do the checking with an assistant after the assistant has checked that you have the right place then you need to pass on to the document control where the policeman is going to ask you about your passport to check in that you have the right name on it after that then you have to wait to be called to get on board of the airplane in order one to one
to study more effectively students can use the technology of their smartphones for example there they can do calendars where they can write it down all they have to do during day the weeks and the month
a face to face class is equally the same as having online because with the use of the new technologies you can talk directly to your teacher through your computer so for me it does n't make any difference between doing face to face or online class
also you can ask for questions to your partner that maybe you did n't listen before or you can get help from them with the organization of the work
because when you go and see your teacher speaking about a subject then you can get more more attention into details he can explain a little bit further there is easier to understand maybe
the facilities provided by the university are basics nowadays because with the use of the technology we can improve our research for example if you need to buy a book or you need to read about some interesting topic then you can go and sit on the computer and get it right away
i am interested in environment and also i am worried because people use a lot of plastics and we are concerned about this
well go to the cinema in summer go to the beach but this summer is a little different but we love go out together and go running or other sports this is all
maybe physically it 's my mother but in personality probably my brother or father my father because my father is more relaxed and more independent and me too
well in my opinion the advantage of doing fitness classes in the school time is that all students can practice sport and so they are more healthy and the disadvantage is that in the school they need to reduce the time of other subjects maybe maths or maybe language or i do n't know but need to reduce another subject in my opinion it 's a good idea because children and teenagers usually do n't practice sport and it 's very important for their health so it 's a good idea
in the picture i can see a diagram about honey and how honey comes to the flower or the flower and goes to the shop well first a big fish collect nests from the flowers and they make honey from nests in the beehives later the beekeepers who is the person who honey collect the honey and put in the top and

i spent my free time when i was a child riding bike
who would like to be in the future manager
i would like to start saying the advantage in my opinion this kind of measures assure that the students acquire the skills that they will meet in their future work in my opinion must be a compromise between the study and practical time for taking the best of the both

if the leader is honestly all the people work really good
i agree with this because the team leader must be encouraged if they are encouraged the team follows them wherever they go to
i think that not because some things in the actuality are working in remote and this is perfect for some kind of works because not all people need to stay together for work good
it depends because some task is better that only one person develops it if this person knows exactly how to do it it 's perfect for one person only
my favorite time of the year is maybe when summer arrives in the town i love to go to the beach i love clothes like to put in a dress
it 's necessary to get well known what is going on in your city and your country so

i hope i will be working on something relative to human resources that gives me time to travel and maybe buy a car to see spain
also enables a student to develop their skills on the other hand we have the disadvantage it could be that the internship are not well paid in my own opinion i think is a good idea to be a trainee in some company and learn about real problems and also work in a team and have a boss who will show you how to do things
the past week has been launched three new online pop music sites in this graph we can see that music now is the online pop music site that have the most in craze of visitors in the weekend followed by songs now for you
for me a good team leader should be empathic with other people get always ready to fix any problem quickly keep the team united to have one direction
work with small teams has problems like people get overwhelmed by the amount of work and maybe they do n't get along between companions and also they can get tired to do almost the same task
absolutely but it 's good to express your ideas and know each other is basic to work in a team
not totally but i think it 's better face to face for example by email or video conference and that 's because you can misunderstood on these ways and that 's why i prefer face to face
from a point of view i agree with these people who think that there is better result working in a team and that 's because everyone has flaps and maybe in a team there is someone who can fill with other skills
it is located in the north of china and it 's also a coastal city with beautiful sceneries there are many beautiful beaches in my hometown if you got time you have to get there and relax yourself
i enjoy playing video games with my buddies and when it is sunny days we often have a barbecue in the park and then go to the nightclub if it is rainy days we often watch movies at home like a couch potato
it should be my mom because my mom is a mathematical teacher and i 'm very interested in math so we often study together and when i 'm in a bad mood she often helps me and gives me a comfort so i appreciate her most
it would be a bit to become a math teacher because i 'm very interested in math and i 'm more than interested to talk about with others in math and i really enjoy the satisfaction that teaching other knowledge brings me
it what 's more it can help them to improve their communicative skills it helps them to know how to communicate with the people around them but the disadvantage is that maybe part time jobs will take their time too much that they would n't concentrate on their study so in my opinion universities should balance their time on part time jobs and the studies
here is an illustrating about how to travel by plane first travel to the airport by bus by taxi or by train and after you arrive at the airport you have to check in make sure you have all the i d cards certificates visa and so on after that and then you have to have your document controlled if you finish these steps then you have security check and then you have to wait for a while after that when your flight is going to take off you got ta upload and then just enjoying your flight
by surfing some educational website students can acquire a lot of useful educational information and it can help them enhance their educational skills and help them to get high score
i agree with that when you have a license face to face with teachers you will be more focused on your study and you would like to communicate with your teachers about some questions he can help you freely with any time
it can help them to develop cooperative skills and the communicative skills and the organization to skills because
i think attending lectures would be better because the professor and advisor will help you to point out your further study directions and they can help you to relax your stress from mid bias study or something
modern learning facilities could bring advanced knowledge around the world and students can use it for relaxation or some useful information from the internet so i think it 's very important
i believe that learning about other countries and their culture is very important since i am a teacher i consider it to be really important because in this way you know the people and how they work or learn
most of my free time i spend it with my family with my wife my son and sometimes my parents we have to have a nice night drinking a beer and maybe eating some pizza
from my perspective the best way to improve your english is to use it in a real way for example speaking with people whose first language is english for example i also like to use speaking improve

having a part time job during our university studies can bring some advantages and some of its advantages well this advantage could be that you can have less time to do your homework for example and an advantage could be that if your part time job is related to the career then it will help you because you will apply what you are learning in the university and if it does n't work you can learn from that experience so in my opinion it 's very important for students to have a part time job however this part time you must be related to their bachelor degrees so it will learn more
it is well known that rain is a natural phenomenon however factories and vehicles produce pollution and this pollution is mainly acid particles in smoke and these particles are carried by the wind and some particles fall as dust and on the other hand there are other particles that mix with the clouds and these clouds producing water or snow and make full this acid particles over the trees over the animals over even over of our cars and this can be harmful and it damages the nature
since our bodies are conformed of ninety six percent of water it 's very important that we drink water however as you said before drinking lots of water maybe can be very harmful
maybe doing exercise every day can be excessive if you are a beginner in this field however maybe three days per week can be very effective if you want to have a healthy life and then you can go on and work harder
in my own perspective i consider that it depends on the person i sleep eight hours and that 's enough for me however need ten hours and there are other people who need just six hours and they are done
i consider that technology indeed affects us however i believe that it will affect you more the more you use it
the place where i live it 's really quiet at a surrounding village and you have the possibility to go to the center of the city but you do n't live there so
well i enjoy traveling that 's the best activity that i can do when i am on holidays
i enjoy spending time with my sister because we can do a lot of physical activities and well we have the same interest so
in the future i would like to work as a teacher because i study to be teacher and i really like to be teacher in public education in spain
well i think university students want to pay their own studies because it 's really difficult for the families to get the amount of the money that you need to pay your studies so the advantage well you are independent of your family and are economically independent the disadvantages are obviously you have less time to study so that 's not good for your degree in my opinion for me it 's more important the independence and not to be a charge for your family so you need to have a job and be able to pay your own studies
first of all you have to travel to the airport so you could do this travel by train on a bus or by car well when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and show your documentation because it 's necessary to leave a country well you have to pass the security control and then you have to wait
they are tools to
it depends because in some occasions when you attend lectures you learn a lot because the teacher it 's good at his job but in other occasions attending lectures is not effective because it 's the same that you read a lot
it 's important because the way that the students learn is changing all the time so that 's important to modernize your style of teach to be attractive for the students
i 'm interested in learning about holding cultures
i enjoy my free time playing baseball or traveling
i think the best way to improve my english skill is to communicate with foreign people in english
one of the advantages to do part time jobs is to learn about society but one of the disadvantages is to lose study in university so i think all university students should do part time jobs
first the smoke of pollution is emitted by vehicles and factories then the particles are in smoke are carried by a window then some acid particles fall as dust in the ground and other acid particles mix with cloud water then acid particles are in rain or snow fall to the ground then they damage to environment
you can eat breakfast because it 's most important eating
it is important to drink water because drinking water makes us so healthy and
i think it is important to do exercise every day because doing exercise makes me so healthy and okay
just short i live in gran canaria a fantastic island with one of the best weather of the world here at parrot beach we have a fantastic mountains and people here are wonderful
when i 'm on holiday for me it 's essential relax me but always as i ca n't i lie i love traveling and discover new places in the world with my family and friends
of all my family i think the person who i have best moment is with my mother because we are very similar in the way that we think
i would like to work in other sections so for it i 'm learning language because it 's essential for this type of score another good thing of this score is to meet with people from all over the world
not all the students have enough money to pay their needs during university if one advantage of getting a job is that they can have the money to buy the things that they need during all the course they do n't have to worry about how may ends meet on the other side disadvantage could be that they do n't have the same time to study like other students that do n't need a job
for go to the airport you have to choose one option you can go by car by bus or by train when you arrive at the airport do n't forget to do the checking in the main decks after that you ca n't pass the document control and the secret control after all this you can wait in the room there you can find toilets and shops and you can eat because there are quite a variety of restaurants when you see on the board the time of your travel you enter in the airplane and here we go you can fly
if there are lots of webpages where you can find free course
from my point of view a really good way but no it 's the only way if you have english friends for instance you can speak with your hand it 's really good too
i think a warring group is a good option because every member of the group can help each other and they can collaborate between day
i do n't be really sure but i think that reading is very good to improve your vocabulary and your writing
i believe it 's very important because if you have a lot of fatalities for the students they can choose the best way to learn an international language
yes of course i live in a neighborhood near to the city center and here we can find everything shops
when i 'm on holiday i love to travel with my family if we can to foreign countries and visit museums eat in different restaurants
i most enjoy having time with my mother because she is very funny and she always has lots of stories to tell me about my infancy about my teenager so i have a good time with her
in the future i would like to be an english teacher because i love being with young people and i love to teach languages to anyone that 's what i do
do n't you see that students should get jobs to pay for their university studies i absolutely agree that we 'll have a lot of advantages for students by getting a job they can experiment what a real job is and that practice will help them to choose a good job for the future you could also have some disadvantages so having a job while you 're studying can rest your time from studying so you may have less free time so you can know what the life life is
this diagram shows the steps you have to follow when traveling by plane first of all you have to travel to the airport you can do it by bus by train or by car and when you arrive to the airport you have to do the check in pass through the document control and pass through the security control and at last you do the boarding then you are into the plane and then you only have to wait till the plane takes off
i think there are lots of options for students to use technology to study more effective they can be gadgets computer programs mobile phones social networks
also you can see how his body moves
i think the most important thing that they can learn in group projects is communication communication is very important in all types of jobs so it could be a good thing for them to learn that 's what i think
i think that attending lectures can be more effective than reading alone because you have to pay more attention to the person who is doing the lecture so i think that concentration will help you a lot
i think it is very important for universities to provide learning facilities to students so i think that 's very important
when i meet with my friends we like to go to the beach go to movies or go to eating at some restaurant
when i graduate i would like to move to the united states because the job opportunities are better than mexico
the disadvantage are the coast i think but
the bees is one of the most important animals for the human existence and also they produce the honey that is a product that the humans consume first bees collect nectar from flowers then they make honey from nectar in beehaves and people that are in church to collect the honey from beehaves are the beekeepers and then then they sell to the stores for the human consumption
i think the most important thing to consider is the country where you can develop professionally and you can learn about your career
i think that there are many advantages of learning a fourthly language because it 's important for the development of your career and your person and
i think the most difficult thing is be far away from your country and
there are many ways to learn about the other countries but the best way is making friends that was born there because
i think that it could be possible but also it can depend on the students and their habits
there are a lot of things to see and do
two or three years ago when i was on holidays always i tried to travel my favorite place is the north of spain but right now with the coronavirus it 's impossible to travel anywhere so i 'm the time in my house
i spend more time always with my daughter because she is not going to the school for the coronavirus at the moment so she is with me twenty four hours a day we will go together to every places
right now i 'm studying for a position to work for the government so for me the perfect work had that i want to work for the government to have stability and a good schedule only in the mornings
the advantage it could be that the job gives them a chance to put in practice skills they have learned in a school the part time have disadvantages because the students feel tired and do n't have time to study while doing part time work work in my opinion it 's necessary to keep in mind the importance of a good balance between school work and part time jobs i 'd rather study first and then work only on vacation in summer
in the diagram i can see how you have to go changing in the apr to traveling by air place the first thing to travel to the apr is taking a bus or a trailway or in a car just there you can park the car or you can down of the bus and go to the exit way later you have to check in your luggage or if you have a luggage it 's not necessary checking anything and then later you have to pass the document control with the police and the security later you have to wait you
the use of technological tools motivates and makes it easier for students to hold their attention to be more effective they could be funnier learning technology
i think it 's better face to face than online classes because when you are with a teacher in front of you it 's the concentration and you can learn better
they could separate the projects for example if they are three they can do a part for each one
in my opinion it 's better reading alone than attending lectures with more people because when you are alone the concentration is bigger than in a group so for me it 's better to read alone
i really love to learn about more countries and specifically more about europe their culture about their food about their language about almost everything i think that it 's very interesting to know about their history
to be honest i do n't have like a lot of free time however if i have some hours of awesome minutes i spend it like cooking some cakes and also or sorry doing some exercise
the best way to improve my english is not by studying if not by practicing speaking with other people and also watching series in netflix in english
if i could learn another skill maybe i would choose learning french and german this is because the entire world speaks those languages
as we can know there are many students that also have a part time job part time jobs have advantages and disadvantages but first advantages we can see that people who make internships can make a little more mistakes than full time job workers and however in the part of this advantage people who may have a part time job are very concentrated on the job or in the school part
the process began with factories and vehicles spreading pollution then it transformed to acid particles in smoke the wind is carrying some acid particles for all the environment but some acid particles fought as dust however other acid particles mix with cloud water finally acid particles are in rain or snow this gives us a lot of damage to our environment it 's bad for our health
in my opinion it 's a shell to go to another geologist they will give you a diet for your body and with this you can improve your eating habits and
i think that a good recommendation to drink more water is to have a big bottle and you will always carry on with you to remember that you have to drink it
i think that it is not very essential to do an exercise every day but often i recommend it this is not because about your weight it is because more about your health and good habits
i think that it depends on each one i would recommend like at least six hours per day but if you can sleep essential for you it 's okay
i think that it depends on what do you need and the technology
i 'm very interested in learning other countries because i love travel and know other cultures and other people
in my free time i love to go out with my dog and i love to work with him and i love reading books too on the sofa because it relaxes me a lot
i think that the best thing to improve my english is to go abroad and practice with other people i go to an english class twice a week to improve my english too
one thing that worries people is the money when we are studying it 's common that we do n't have enough money and we want to do a lot of things with our friends a lot of students have a part time job to do at the same time as the university it has a lot of for example they have more money they can work abroad but these advantages are for example they do n't have enough time to study their degrees my
factories and vehicles produce pollution acid particles are in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wine some of these acid particles fall as dust another acid particles mix with cloud water and then these acid particles are in rain or snow to sign up they are the base to environment
i think it 's important to eat healthy and do n't eat for example fast food and grass food and increase vegetables in our diet
i think it 's very important to drink water because we have to hydrate our body because
i think that to do exercise is very important but not all the day it 's possible so we have to do exercise almost twice or three times a week
my opinion technology is a bad way to relax because we have to disconnect in our free time
my favorite moment of gr is the summer time because i can enjoy my free time and i can enjoy my family
it is not very important because nowadays the news are bad and sad and i prefer with a book or watch a series
i hope to be the best friend t shirt in a school i hope to do a project with my crafting manual
this question is very interesting because young people is prepared to work in the moment when they finish their studies in this case it 's impossible because they have between twenty or twenty two years old for that reason this idea has so many advantages for young people and for the companies and they can determine if they wo n't continue with this war or not
hello as you look this graph shows how much people are visiting three new online pop music sites tunisnet song for a music now in the first one you can see that in the first day there were more people seeing music now between sixteen thousand and eighteen thousand of people in the rest of the day this music site music now is the winner reaching him first and fifth day between one thousand and twenty of people that heard this site however in the seventh day there were more listeners of tunednet reaching one thousand of people
ok a good team leader should be a person with character
yes i think each one can express their opinion of the project but this person must contribute with a new idea
and in addition they can resolve problems that can be appeared
i think it is true because each one can have different ideas to do the project in the best way
this is a really small but cute town with a lot of young people there is also a beach and the weather is pretty good
in my spare time i enjoy going out with my friend and going to the fair one because i 'm a strength seeker i also enjoy playing basketball since i 've been played for ten years
i really enjoy spending time with my father because this is my best friend and we have a lot of things in common as basketball and also eating and doing some shopping
my aim is to become a lawyer so i 'm working really hard for it because it 's my dream since i have six so yeah i want to work in law
the main advantage of working during your study to pay the university cost is the fact that permits to students to have more responsibility and independence on the other hand students can be less focused on course and it can be a bad thing for their grade but as far as i 'm concerned working can be a good solution for students who ca n't afford the price of a great university nevertheless when students have the choice i think that they should avoid working at the same time that they are studying
first of all you can go to the airport by feet you need to take a car a bus or a train when you arrive at the airport you go to the check in and show your i d or your passport so people of the airport can verify your identity after that you pass a security guard and then you are at the waiting place there is a lot of things you can eat take a cafe and also buy some gifts for your family for example after that this is the boarding time and you get in the airplane then your travel can start
and they can use it for example for replacing the time they spent in library because it 's easy and real quick to find out the information you need in internet nowadays
as far as i 'm concerned you do n't need to be face to face and staring at people to learn for example today there is a virus and then everybody are on their own home and studying from there but the result is good too
everybody has to present his own point of view somehow and
yeah sure because when you attending to lectures you are in the mood you are in a good environment to learn and improve your skills and
for me it 's not really important because what is important is the effort you put on your work every day because you to improve you need to exercise
i live in madrid also it is a crowded city and i really enjoy it it 's bustling history and you can do many things there to a theater
i really enjoy going with my relatives to my mother 's village we really get along well together so we spend a really good time there
i mostly enjoy spending time with my mother since i think we understand really well together and we get along well
my dream job is to set up my own business a social one and be my own boss and contract employees in order to get a work life balance because currently i do n't have it
as i see it only a university student should work part time or even full time in order to be able to support by themselves or to be self sufficient so to sum up i have to say that as i see it working while studying it is a good way to gain experience and also maybe in the future they will be able to have a better paid job than if they did n't work husbands
when traveling by airplane people and first they need to travel to the airport by their own way for example by their car or they can take an uber or a public pass after that they need to do the boarding pass and the security control and if they pass this they will have to wait to wait maybe for a long time having lunch or shopping after that you need to do along queue in order to board and then you have a seat that it is on your boarding documents and after that the play has taken off and you need to turn off your devices and your mobile phone
and currently we have a weight range of possibilities and using technology for studying is a good choice you can search on internet and you can share with your colleagues information
i mean totally agree with that point of view since if you learn face to face with your teacher and also with other students you will be able to act if you have any doubt also you can speak with your teacher
they can develop a wide range of skills such as communication skills social skills loyalty for me the most important one is communication and the only way to improve it is speaking
well it depends on the kind of person you are if you have the ability to be concentrated at classes it would be for sure a better ocean than studying by the run however there are people that feel that they progress more at home
university facilities is the place where you are going to stay most of your time during your university studies
i really hate my town because it has no shops no cinemas hardly anything
well as i usually fail my final exams my summer holidays tend to start very late so when it comes by mid of july i really like to do nothing like staying bed all day
well although it sounds a little bit evil i really do n't like to spend so much time with any of my family because they can be so annoying sometimes so i prefer to stay alone or with my friend
so as a physics student i really like to work in the future probably in the nasa
well at one hand i think that it could be a really good option for a student because by that they are going to have experience so in the future they can add it on the cvs so enterprise contract them but on the other hand i think that a student if you are at university your main objective is to study and to get your degree and if you are working obviously you are n't going to have the total time to dedicate to your career probably you are going to fail some subject or anything like that
so if you are going to travel by airplane first of all you have to obviously go to the airport depending on the facilities of the city you could go by tram or train by bus or by your own taxi or your own car so once there you have to go to your company gate check your logout then you have to pass the security control where a policeman controls your passport and your i d and check your logout when you pass the security control probably you have to wait in waiting room or you can go to a cafe then
for example i have an ipad so when i 'm not in the mood for being studied i would prefer to stay in bed but as i said i could bring my ipad to the bed and study my notes being warm in my bed
well obviously it depends on the teacher and the subject that you are studying but in my own experience i would say that i prefer a book rather than a teacher
so first of all if you work in groups you 'll have to deal with people so you could develop your empathy or sympathy skills being nice to other people
as i said earlier it will depend on the subject on my own experience it 's preferable to read a book alone because most of my teachers are inexperienced teaching students
well in my opinion it is a very important matter in
it 's so beautiful in my opinion a big castle we have a great food and drink
i really like traveling it 's my main hobby i think and i try to find the best prices the best offer to travel and i always travel once for my holiday
i prefer to stay with my brother because we have a lot of things in common he is very funny in my opinion like me and yeah i love this boy
i 'm a chemist and i would like something about chemists but try to research something important and something about environment
my opinion the main advantage about get jobs to pay your university studies is you can have your family to pay these studies your parents ca n't support all the studies usually at least in spain the main disadvantage is the time it 's difficult to have the same qualification the same marks with a job
okay first you have to travel to iepor then in the iepor you should look for people 's stuff to do the checking then when you do the checking you pass the document control and the security you are okay to board in the airplane and so if you have time you could wait and take a coffee or buy a gift then you board and start your name enjoy
in my opinion technology could be very useful for students because they want to use application on mobile phone or the laptop to improve their way to study
but nowadays maybe with technology it 's enough in a lot of ways to learn
a student can acquire a lot of skills because you need to work in a group in your daily life
in my opinion i prefer to read all alone because it 's better for concentrating i think in my opinion attending lectures could be a lot of distraction for the students
i think it 's very important learning facilities for students because the university is like one door to their real life and they need a lot of facilities to work and to life
i love the traditions and different cultures and i 'm so interesting in that and i think it 's so very clever to know about the other countries i want that
i love watching series on netflix or prime video and anyways i love playing or staying with my family too playing with my dog getting out with my friends i love to have a good time
i think listening to music in english listening to i love to watch serials in english because it 's the original language and reading a lot in english books or something like that
and i would like to have friendship with all the people in this world talking
so we know that the air pollution comes from factories and vehicles so these pollution go up and make acid particles that are in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wind and that makes that they cooled mix with other particles and some acid particles fall as dust in the floor so acid particles are in rain snow normally and that provokes the damage to emboring paint
first of all they should drink a lot of water it 's too important and eat a lot of fruits it 's so important because these fruits have the proteins and vitamins that our body needs
it 's very good to do exercise every day a little bit but you have to have a routine and do a little bit for example fifteen minutes per day it 's
well i think so i think it is very important to sleep sorry because sleeping makes you feel better makes you feel your body with more energy and that 's so important
obviously a negative because maybe for your ace it 's so bad but
is a town located in the city of huelva you can find this town in the south of spain in the middle between seville and huelva
so honestly i really enjoy having enough time to do as many things as i want to do try to do things which i have never done before
i ca n't choose one person of my whole family however if i have to say just one i could say my cousin because we are the same age and we have been our whole life together
i would like to be an international lawyer because i am deciding which filed of law is more accurate for me and i think i would like to solve international problems or international issues
so in the one hand work for paying the university studies provide you to be finally independent and you can manage your own money you can decide for what you are going to spend or you are going to manage your own money in the other hand as a disadvantage you have to work at the same time you are studying and you are not going to have a free time or enough time for you but on my own opinion it 's really important working while you are studying because you can appreciate the free time and the effort you 're
i 'm going to talk about traveling by airplane so when you have a flight you have to travel you have to go to the airport and you have many different ways to go there which is car bus or train and then you the security control to avoid you have provided things with you and maybe you have to wait just five ten minutes and you can stay at the restaurant and then you have to board in the airplane and
so technology is an important tool to learn a lot of things
in my opinion the teacher has to teach face to face because a student or the teacher can provide more information more knowledge and
i think the most important skill students have to have is to communicate and organize organization is really important to create an amazing project and
in my opinion attending lectures can be perjudicial for the students
i think it 's really important to provide learning facilities because the student can be more concentrated on the matter because he has the facilities and
i really appreciate the environment where we live so i think that i personally feel that all of us should look after our land and i firmly believe that if each one do its part we will get better
we have a very soft spot for watching series together however i prefer watching films on netflix to watch series together because i really appreciate my time
i have to admit that by far the people which i 'm really similar to is my mother because our face is quite similar and also when we are speaking sometimes people are confusing our voices because they are so similar
when i was a child i used to think that i would like to live in london however actually i am used to living in a little town like for example now in basel or before in poland i really like small towns
so let 's begin by speaking about the advantages of this idea i firmly believe that taking a short time per day to have some exercise would be a really good benefit for students to being active and as well there are also some disadvantages like for example schools will miss time for doing the lessons like for example science and another part would be that maybe some students do n't want to do exercise so they will lose time at the school but although all these advantages and disadvantages i firmly believe that this idea is really good and it should be recognized by schools and the schools should take part to go ahead
so well today i will talk about how bees produce honey so let 's begin by told that bees collect nectar from flowers outside so they collect the nectar and they bring the nectar to their home where they make honey from nectar in bee hives after all of that there is a human part where bee keepers collect honey from bee hives and the same person puts the honey in different bottles and that 's all i have to say in this productive part
i mean how many would cause the alimentation there and all this stuff
studying a second language would help you to improve your abilities to speak another language and this will also be too much useful when you want to get a new job for example because the more you know the more you understand the world
this is a very difficult question because depending on the students
firstly if the students want to know something about local culture they should go into traditional parties for example or ask to local people there
i have to confess that i totally agree with that statement because i believe that all people need one moment in their life to feel comfort with themselves and to develop their independence
i live in a three bedroom house it is located at slab bank in the city center and it is very nice and cozy house and i love to stay at home rather than going out in current scenario of virus
so holiday is a part of life which i never want to miss and when i am in holiday i love to do tracking and capture scenic views of landscapes which is one of my favorite hobby as well
okay so this is a tricky question but he is just one year old and all the day i love to enjoy his naughtiness and playing with him with different kind of games and
talking about the job i would love to do a teaching job and
according to my opinion nowadays students should do the part time job in order to pay for their university studies which may help to broaden their horizon in terms of new skill which helps them boost their personality besides this they can learn tremendous skills in terms of teamwork which is helpful to boost their personality and that might be helpful in studies as well talking about the cons of this in my knowledge there is just one disadvantages of the job which is devoting less time towards the study so i agree that doing part time jobs are way better than doing just only studies
in this day and age we have lots of resources to use like technology internet which can be used to study and learn for according to me one can learn from internet because there are plenty of things on the internet to learn and study
i fully agree with this statement let that face to face learning is the best option because we can get feedback at the time and even by learning face to face we can get all the answers of our queries or questions from the tutor
it helps to build a lot of skills including team skills communication skills and
in my opinion attending lectures are more effective than reading alone one may get bored by reading alone and may fall asleep but attending lectures make its curiosity more and more to learn more
it is extremely important for the university to get updated with the learning facilities like super fast internet and pcs laptops and all these technological devices which are needed for students to help learn and study more
i like to do sports or exercise write to bicycle read books or comics
i can speak english with my boyfriend or with friends
would you like to be in bicycle
the university students all the part time job is i win a lot of money
the acid is created by pollution up in the air the acid particles are in smoke and the acid particles are carried by wind and the acid particle are in rain and snow and i 'm at the environment because it 's very dangerous
i drink in water is very important because my body needs water i call not life with water
in my opinion it is necessary to do a spore every day because the body is healthy and
i think that you have a sleep seven or eight hours in order to have a rested body and eye full battery
the technology is very good because for running i
i live in a big flat which is near to the center of the town it has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and the dining room is very big
i really like spending time with my friends going for a walk or listen to music sometimes watching a film or reading an interesting book you know
my only brother he is very special and we really like going for a walk you know around the forest or talking about any kind of issue or topic
i would love to be a teacher because i really like teaching kids and i also like to have you know really long holidays in the summer
so i think that one of the advantages is that if you do n't have a lot of time to study you concentrate better and your time is more effective you know and on the other hand you will be exhausted and with no time for your friends so i think you have to be very careful if you get a job while you are studying so in my opinion if you can do n't work at the same time but sometimes life challenge us so why i can tell you go for it and study and work like it 's the best thing you do
if you want to traveling by plane there are few steps that you need to know first of all you have to go to the airport in some transport like by car or by bus or train then you arrived to the airport and it 's time to do the checking pass through document control and then say the security works we 'll see if everything is okay then you have to wait in the waiting room you can eat something or go to the bathroom or restroom or take a coffee and drink a coffee and finally they will call you on board and it 's time to take off the plane
so they can search information in the internet to improve their knowledge and
yes i think it 's more special you know because the teacher can ask your doubts in the moment
they will learn how to work together and do n't have always the right opinion and share responsibilities i think it 's very good
yes i think when someone lectures you you will cut out more information than by yourself and then later you can read along everything to understand it
i think it 's on the top of everything
very interested unfortunately i do n't have money to travel abroad but i am very interested in learning about other countries cultures and languages
i like reading i like listening to music i like watching tv and netflix i like cooking too i like making desserts for my family
for me is listening to music and watching cartoons i watch a lot of cartoons and listen to a lot of music in english and for me that 's the best way for me obviously for other people that are different way to that
i think i would like to learn languages like really just other languages i am fascinated by that
talking about university students and part time jobs they should be doing that i mean what are the advantages are they would know the outside world as it is itself the advantage would be that they would n't have time to focus on the studies what they should be doing but in my own opinion most of the students that are not able to pay for college they 're already doing part time jobs so if everyone did it would be just fair to everyone everyone would know the word as it is itself and everyone would have the advantage of not having one hundred percent of your time to focus on studying
acid rain is really easy to understand hear me out factories and vehicles that produce smoke some of these acid particles can fall as dust and they cause damage to the environment other acid particles the more light ones they are mixed with cold water so when there 's water in the colds they precipitate as rain or snow it 's not just water or snow that 's raining it 's water and snow or snow plus acid so it causes a lot of damages in the environment it 's really easy
first of all look for nutritionists if they 're good they 're going to give you a really good system that you can work with and that will be close to what you 're used to and you will create the habit of reading good things
not every day but at least two to three times a week exercises are good for your health or good for your body so you have to keep your body functioning good and exercises are going to help with that so do it at least two to three times a week
i totally agree it 's on our lips and our body recovers our energy there are metabolisms work better so it 's on our lips that know our body functions are you know recycling themselves so sleep eight hours people is
i think technology is a tool and as a theory can be used as a positive and a negative effect so in this case in my head a negative effect but it 's not technology for its peoples
i 'm so really interested in environment because we have the responsibility of the world
i really like going to the cinema with them because we load very much and then we ca n't speak about the film we have just seen i like it so much
well i think my husband is similar to me because we understand each other and we love very much together we think many things similar
i would like to live in london for example because i would like to learn the english language i think in spanish in spain is so difficult to speak it
i think the advantages are for example that it is necessary to our health but the disadvantages are for example that we can do fitness out of the classes of schools and colleges i think the students can do every fitness classes in the gym out of the school in my opinion i think it 's so important the sports and it could be possible that you try fitness classes
well i am explaining how honey is produced honey bees collect nectar from the flowers and go to the hives the bees make the honey from the nectar and then beekeepers collect the honey from these beehives and then they directly go to the shop and in the shop the costume by them
well i think students choosing a country like a london because they look at the party on the university it was okay
they find difficult in the language in the culture
they can learn about the shuttle
i think it 's absolutely absolutely true because they need to have lands alone to cook to to pay payment
the place in which i live it 's very beautiful and it 's very very tranquility
when i have a holiday i enjoy to listen to music past time with my family and do exercise with my friends and read books
my family and i like to eat in our favorite restaurant because we enjoy eating a lot of food
i would like to have my own company in the future and help my family economically because it is very important to me to do this
to get jobs to pay your university studies have some advantages like you can have independent economy and you can have more laboral experience
as you can see in the diagram if you can travel to another country first first of all you have to travel to the airport and and finally you must wait for the airplane and finally you can board the airplane
students show you the technology to practice their activities in the university to understand in a better way the concepts and information that your professors give them
it 's important the face to face learning because you can ask some questions to the professor if you have doubts and point
group projects is an interesting thing in which you can learn more about your topics because you experiment with the activities
attending lectures it 's important to use because you can hear specialized professors so you can learn more about the topics
i 'm from yokohama so i tell you about yokohama yokohama has many sightseeing places so for example chinatown or museum chinatown is a good place
i always enjoy playing american football and talking with my friends so i belong to american football club so i like american football and playing american football
i spent free time with my little brother he is ten years old so i like him and i read books to my brother
i want to be a pilot so i want to work in aviation company i like airplanes and commercial planes so i want to work there
i think all students should not get jobs to pay for their university studies i have two reasons first we should study on focus in universities second that is why i think all students should not get jobs to pay for their university students
okay i will tell you about traveling by first you arrive at airplane by transportation like a car or a bus or train and then you have to check clean and you go to document control to check your box and luggage third step you should wait at home and you can go to the restroom and eat the lunch its launch finally you can board on the airplanes
we can use technology instead of our brain because i think we use brain to use only consider
i think face to face is an important thing because we can communicate with people on face to face we express our feelings
i think attending lecture is better than studying alone because ask
i think it is necessary to provide learning more than facilities because we must catch up with error so we can get knowledge
well i 'm really interested in learning about other countries because for my career i need to learn about our culture how they deal with the bar gains and all these things so i prefer to take advantage from knowing about these cultures and make my deals
i 'm keen on doing exercise it 's very important for me for example i 'm going to the gym and make some and exercise with the dumbbells and well i feel stronger and feel good with myself so for me it 's incredible
i get a boss from listening music it 's incredible because you can put your headphones and improve your skills in english because you can listen some words that you never listen in your life so that is the best way to learn and maybe reading
well i would prefer to learn gypsy rather than learn about i do n't know other topics because it 's very important for me that movements feel great with me and with my body i want to reach my limits
many students at this moment do part time jobs however these have many advantages you can develop new skills and the things that professional environment wants to other people improve your know how about the things that you learn in school on the other hand the disadvantages of this is that many students that have time or maybe are not very organized to do these things and it 's difficult for many people yes but however in my opinion you need to do this and take the risk to make the bold things because in the future many companies will be impressed about your story that how do you know all these things and well you can say well i was a student and employee so i can do both
so in this presentation i 'm going to show how the ac rain is formed through the pollution and in these particles mixed with the cloud water and maybe in the future this could be a very very harmful for many people in their skin and they could suffer some dramatically situations because the environment is not the best for us at this moment so we need to save the environment and clean the things
well i recommend people take one five liters of water every single day to be hydrate and feel comfortable with themselves that is important because the water is live and the live is very important for everyone you know
yeah for me it 's very essential
well as we said technology is very important right now people need these new devices to improve their health and i think it 's the best way to improve the lives of people with the technology
i think it 's interesting because you know about different things also you know about how people think or how people do things so i think it is very important and also it is very straight interesting
i like to do different activities in my free time for
i like to do different things to improve my english i like to watch movies a lot because it helps me to improve my speaking and my listening also i like to read my favorite books also
i want to learn swimming because i think it 's very important also it is very good for our health our body to be fit to keep fit also it is important i think
first of all i think the advantages of part time for students how studying is it will help them to focus on another thing not just at studying and it will help them to reduce their stresses and also get money that helps them at their study but i think that this advantage is that they may be focused on their work and forgive their studying is in my opinion i think it is a very good idea to work part time because it helps them to be more relaxed calm and happy
the iced rean started from factories and officials and they go out and they win ticket to the wind and mixed with clouds and some of it fill us just and the other ice particle mixed with cloud water ice and practices are in rain or snow so it 's come to earth by raining or snowing and our strain is very damaged to our environment so
i advise them to reduce eating avoid eating fast food and drink a lot of water also eat a lot of vegetables and fruit because it is very important for health and
drinking lots of water is very important because it cleans our body from dirt also it is very important for our brain because it makes it work well
i think it is very important to do exercise every day because it is very important for for our brain and it is reduce our stresses also to help us to be more relaxed and happy and also keep our body fit
i think it is right also
i think it is a negative effect for people health because nowadays we just stay at the computer or any technology and eat and everything come to us so i think we should look at our life and try to change it
i 'm very interested as we all live in the planet and
we like both playing sports and having some drinks we usually play some football matches on weekends and then we usually go to bars and have some beers and talk about life
almost everybody says i take after my mother they say we are like and i think that 's the answer my mother i looked on photos of her as children and
i do n't really know yet but maybe in another country just to explore new places new curators new idioms and new folk and new people of course
i think that 's a good idea but more for schools than college in they but i do n't really see any disadvantages maybe in college because they are avoiding to study more important things my opinion this is necessary in schools get an ep class
so this diagram shows how honey is produced at first there are animals that are called bees that collect nectar from flowers many flowers they travel to their bee heaps where all the bees make honey but not in a way we can consume it so that 's the beekeeper 's aim the bottle and getting the transport usually banned or any other types of transport and just getting soaps to get by the bottle
they should consider things as the culture they have the idiom they speak the language they speak
studying second language it 's difficult but your second language will improve a lot if you study and talk every day in that second language and
maybe being by themselves and not living with their families and
they know about local culture every day when they communicate they talk with native speakers and they are living in the streets every day visiting monuments and eating their own food
that 's evident when you are not living with your family you are living by yourself with maybe some roommates they will help you to cook by yourself clean everything in the house be more independent
the place where i live it has a very good weather we have a beach so in the weekends we can go out to the beach and spend a good time with our friends and also i like that it 's not that big so we do n't have a lot of traffic
it depends where i got to the holiday but if it 's a beach i prefer sometimes to stay in the hotel and enjoy all the experiences that hotel give us but when it 's to a city i prefer knowing more the city
the last person in my family that i enjoy spending time with it 's my little brother because i can play a lot with him and he 's very funny and i never get bored and also we have like very different characters so we get along a lot
my dream job is to be a professional dancer but i am not studying for that so i think that in the future i will be working as an industrial engineering and i hope to be working in a very sophisticated business
i am going to be talking if a student should get jobs to pay for the university studies and i think that it 's not a must but if we can do it it 's okay like it 's great if we can help out our parents with some money because i know that sometimes it can get really stressful for our parents to pay for our studies because university it 's very expensive everywhere and i also think that we have to just help them out but some of the disadvantages are that sometimes we can get really stressful with that and we can lower our grades in my opinion it 's better if you then do it
i am going to be talking about what you need to do to travel by airplane and first you have to get to the airport you have to go by bus by car by whatever you want then you have to do a check in because that 's a way that you said that you are there on time and they register all your seat cases then you have to go to a document control then pass the security because they do n't allow a lot of items like weapons and knives then you have to pass to an area where you have to wait till you can board to the airplane and finally you board to the airplane and then you are ready to go out to your destination and that 's all
i think technology has given us a lot of good ways to study and one thing we can use technology is we can record ourselves and then listen once and again the recording to memorize everything more easily and fast
i agree with them because when we have virtual classes we do n't pay the same attention than when we have face to face professor because we do n't feel the pressure of giving our hundred percent in the class
i think that the most important skill that we develop is that we get to improve our communication and also to be very patient with our friends because sometimes we get very stressful that they do n't do anything and yeah
i think reading alone it 's better because we are focused in what we are reading and when we do a thing in lectures i think that we lose a little bit the focus of what we are reading so
a lot because nowadays we have like a lot of technology and a lot of different new things that we can use for us to learn more like for example there are a lot of pages online that have games for us to have more entertaining way to learn
i separate the trash and use products that can be reused and when i 'm not at home i turn off the lights and use just ecological products
my mom is more similar to me we enjoy the things do the same things and we have them the same racks of face
i would be delighted if i live at the beach i would enjoy a love to the sound of the sea
nowadays mexico it 's the number one ad obesity that it 's very bad for use so the schools and the universities need to include experts ' classes to help the population to be a healthier lifestyle and do campaigns to decrease the range of obesity
good morning and thanks for coming today i will talk about how honey is produced first you know that the bees collect the nectar from flowers next the bees make honey from nectar in beehives the beekeepers collect the honey from bee hives and
the most important aspect to consider when you want to choose the city or the country where you are going to study is that this country has a lot of security for you
actually all the boss need to have more qualified employees so
i think that the most difficult situation is that you are far from home you do n't know a lot of people in the new country but you need to do a lot of new friends to do n't be alone
the easier way to know about other culture at your new country is talk with people and make new friends that teach you the culture of the country
we enjoy doing together for example watching a tv program playing football or cook in my kitchen even we prepare different subjects for the exams
the most similar member in my family is my father because physically we are really the same weight the same face and
in the future i like that i will be in singapore because i am in love with the technological advances and their politicians
as far as i 'm concerned the crux of the matter is that one of these advantages are for example that during your class you will keep fit and you are a healthy body one of these advantages that i think is that if you go to school to study and you in the school to do fitness classes you in your house need to spend more time to prepare your lesson in your exams because
in the first moment bees take the nectar into the flowers next bees with this nectar make honey in beehives when beekeepers use the bees ' honey from beehives to fulfill different bottles and with these bottles inside a car or a track the bottles are transferred to different and diverse supermarkets for example local shops big commercial centers or even your house and when you have the bottle in your supermarket with one or two pounds you can buy this
i guess that the advantage are that when you are studying an issue and you learn about this you only learn one thing but if you study in a second language you can learn both things at the same time really
it 's difficult because you need to get on other people you need to make more independent things such as wash your kitchen or sweep the floor and it 's very hard when you live alone
i believe that you do n't really know the local culture when you go abroad during the weeks you can see other people you can hear different things and then you learn about this local culture
obviously when you live alone or you live with your classmates or college you will have more responsibilities because when you live in your country and you are a student normally you live with your partner and you a student
gadith is a very sunny city it has two main beaches and the weather is really comfortable it 's always sunny and a little bit windy and
when i 'm on holiday i mostly travel to different countries and i 'm very interested in the culture of the central northern new york so whenever i have the opportunity i travel there so i can see the cities their aesthetics their architecture i 've seen museums and so on
and even our characters are very much alike we do n't resemble each other well
but in the model of the english speaking countries i really think that yes i agree with the decision of getting a job to pay for the university studies just because you do n't have to depend on banks and you do n't have a loan for years you can grow as a person you can learn how to manage your time and then you are able to enter the adult life the main disadvantages i see are that although it has many benefits you also will have less time to study less time to spend with your friends less time for yourself ultimately
well traveling by airplane is one of the most common ways to travel nowadays and the stages you need to follow to travel by plane are the next first you have to travel to the airport by car by bus by train and then you have to check in with your company then pass a document control with the police and the security control they check your bats and after that you have to wait for the boarding hour to your plane then board and then the plane flies to your destination
i really agree with that affirmation because teachers have the knowledge and have the knowledge to pass on their own knowledge so that 's a very important skill and
i think group projects are great to learn the basic skill of teamwork which you will need along your professional life most definitely although it can also lead to distractions and to confrontation but i think that 's a very positive skill to get
yes definitely i think that attending to lectures is one of the best ways to grasp the concept that you can potentially not understand when studying by your own and yes i agree
learning facilities are the pinnacle stone of learning if
i 'm so interested and the environment i try to help it because it 's all home
we 've much enjoyed doing together go to a party to get out to go and how can i say that eat or dancing or singing i love to go to the pool
the most similar for me is i have a twin is he is younger than me but only for three minutes and
so you must need to be prepared for these fitness classes
next bees make honey from nectar in beehives a part of that the next step is beekeepers collect honey from beehives they must need to be protected then and
starting a second language it 's hard at the beginning but when the time passed you are going to improve your language and you are going to speak normal you
local filter is so important because when you go to other countries you must need to get into this type of filter
i 'm interested in learning other countries and i wanted to learn computer science in united states
my spending fleet armies reading books and watch movies and talking plans and going restaurant
i do n't have idea which one is best one because i 'm just finding now but for so far online learning is best i think
i wanted more communicative talkative skills and i wanted more i want to talk with more people
the advantages are good salary and yeah the students understand what 's going on when they will work in the future but disadvantages are they do n't have a time to study so in my opinion should n't do part time jobs while they 're studying because yeah some students want to study more studies so yeah
and secondly acid particles are carried by wind and the other areas and next some acid particles fall as dust to the runt or the others acid particles mixed with cloud water and finally rain rain falls and acid particles are in rain and getting acid rain and damage to environment
please eat more vegetables and fruits and do n't eat much meat or some kinds of ingredients
drinking water is important because people have eighty percent of human body is water so please drink water
every day doing exercise is not essential but yeah you do it i think and yeah once week exercise is very important
depends on people i think there 's a people who needs seven hours or eight hours but i think and people should know how long they need
well i enjoy spending my free time in two ways one is listening to music and the other is reading books his book is very awesome
well in my opinion the best way for me to improve my english is to form a habit of getting exposed to the environment of english so when i was in class i will always involve myself in the classroom and follow in the classroom 's teachers
well i want to learn how to play the piano because i love its delicate yet powerful sound it makes and i want to play the sweet tone for those who need music bringing happiness and enthusiasm to those who need it that 's all
well as all singles every coin has two assets doing part time jobs both have activities and disadvantages on the one hand doing part time jobs can build our confidence and the lam will provide the chance to improve our skills and prepare for the future jobs but on the other hand if one spends most of the time doing part time jobs the time they spend could be reduced in studying so my opinion is that everyone who want to do pattern jobs should better have a wise consideration before the decision that 's all
ladies and gentlemen it is my honor to be here to give a presentation about the a c rim it starts from the factories and vehicles they give off pollution into the air and the a c particles are in the smoke some so this is how it damages the earth environment ladies and gentlemen we only have one earth and that 's the reason why we should take it we should take care of it thank you for listening
is of great importance and then prepare the lunch and dinner well because it gives you energy
well i think drinking a lot of water is of great importance not only water can protect to us from being thirsty but
so this is the foundation of the happy life we have
well i think this question depends on different individuals because some of the people who need to sleep eight hours or more
i like travel so much
i usually watch tv once a day for my village
the best way for improve my english is talking with english person because we could help you in your english
the advantage that the student should do part time job where they are studying is they could earn money so they will buy anything with your money at this band test they lose time that they can study to prepare your submits in
the center of the city produce the factory produce polluteum and this polluteum is converted in acid particles and in smoke this acid particle fly by green and another particle acid particle in rain or snow
in my opinion the people must eat junk food because the food damages your health they
drink water is really important and you have to drink water five times today a day if really important for your body
yes at least doing exercise once a day you only need thirty minutes it 's enough
i think that it 's okay because you should sleep more than eight hours or less than six hours
i think that it 's possible because you ca n't talk with other person in any moment you can use whatsapp and
i live in a small flat with my boyfriend and my two cats my flat is very small but is very cute and i have a big balcony and the windows are very big too
in my family spending time walking in a forest or going to a campsite sleeping at a tent and doing a fire it
well in the future i will want a job in the human resources department of a factory for example and will do the payrolls and the content
well i think that if you pay the university stories it 's because you try to find a good job but this is not true some people study in the university and do n't find the job for his students in my opinion a lot of people study for example human resources i agree my degree but all people but no people is in job when i employ low or in human refuses department
to travel by plane then the first time you need to travel to the airport by bus by car in car or by train it 's nine port the first thing is checking you 're taking your suitcase for example and the police take your document control and your suitcase if you 're white you can take a coffee or go to a bedroom and then you abort the plane and finally the plane take off
i think that the students can use technologies very important because in the classroom they can take the right exercise in a table in a laptop for example
well i think that it 's better that the people learn face to face to the teacher but now with the coronavirus and the quarantine the skype or the zoom is necessary for the people learning i
well i think it 's very important to work in to do a project in a group because the people learn to listen and communicate and
no i think that the people learn most better alone reading alone because you 're in room in your desk is the best form for learning
i think that it is necessary that university try to do a lot of learning facilities that it 's possible because it 's very important to learn the students
i enjoy meeting friends meeting my family i enjoy studying english searching on the internet on just walking in the park
i most enjoy spending time with my daughter she is a beautiful young woman with creative thinking and she can give me many good advice
i want to get a job a recently future in a non government organization and to like comment and subscribe to my channel
advantages for students who have a job while he is studying at university have experience and skills for his future speciality disadvantages is a lack of time for studying and preparing for tomorrow 's classes in students
at first you should travel to the airport to arrive at inn on time then you need to go to check in your luggage also the police check your documents and security check in your language all your suitcases you should wait while this process finish after that you will be invited to the gate and finally you will board on the plane
technology makes study of students more easier internet engine and e book are partially replacing traditional textbook
i think the studying face to face with your teacher is the best way to study well because the teacher during the process of studying can fix your mistakes
at first is a skill to get along with team members and have good communication this means students must have good communication skills
attending lectures includes communication between teacher and students
providing more learning facilities is very important because it makes it easier for students to study the process
do you know about practice makes perfect everyone say that and it really works and there is the fact that if you really really want to improve your english practice every day
i would be trying anything about creativity and arts because there is something interesting with that
i think the question is about should the part time jobs while they are studying and and the disadvantage for me is maybe the focus is divided because you should do the part time job at the same time where you are studying in the university and my opinion about that is it 's about your preference if you can maintain your time management very well i think should but the part time job is a good thing for me
so some acid particles fall as a dust and the other acid particle mixed with clued weather
i do n't think i have a good advice for this question but my simple advice is reflection while you eating a good food what should motivate to do this it 's come for yourself so
yeah i think so doing exercise is a essential item because it makes your body stretch and make your body health for the future so you must do exercise as much as you can even you busy on doing your work so do it ten minutes again
i think it depends on their age or their activity because human is a complicated system so one another is different so the important thing that you have to remember is sleep enough so yeah
of course in my opinion technology max everything so instantly effective and efficiency it 's positive but the part of you must remember is balance it because everything too much it 's not good for you
i got interested when i was a child i always like to learn about other countries and other languages
i spent my free time reading books watching series watching movies and dancing
the best way i improve my english is reading listening videos podcasts and music and speak in the mural
the events are less time to study and my opinion is important all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because it 's important the students work and study at the same time
well acid rain happens because of pollution as you can see factorins in the cars end up polluting the air with carbon dioxide these particles in the smoking are blown away by the wind and some as the particles fall like dust those blown away by the wind mix with clouds of water then cause acid rain or falling with if is no
drinking water is important because our body up it 's rotating and our kindness needs to keep working
yes doing exercise every day is very important for our body and our health
a good sleep night means a good day of work
lately technology is a great enemy for health because it has become the people 's sedentary
i love their history
i love play football i like play video games and i go to the gym every day
the advantage i think the people then work and studying can have money and opportunities to be experienced
the pollution begins when the factories work and the wind goes out the engine then the pollution goes up for the sky and the wind translates this wind with the sky with the cloud other acid particles meet with cloud water and finally the acid particles are in rain snow doing damage to the environment
okay if you want to be good eating habits you must eat fruits and vegetables and do n't eat hamburgers
it 's very important because the humanity needs to drink water every day if you do n't drink water you can be sick
i think eight hours or seven hours a good time to sleep
i think it 's very positive because you can find new jobs using the technology and you can create your applications or different things for contribute with the technology humanity
interest is because i needed to improve my english
i spend my time with studying english and watching tv series without subtitles
in this moment i speak with you
the disadvantages are that the student will divide their time between work and study if they do not have a discipline it 's a problem is essential to future career
and this acid particle are carried by wind some acid particles fall and dust it to river for example and the other acid particles mix with cloudy water and then rain and transforming your rain and snow and in synthesis is very bad pollution it damages to environment
i think the technology is too different activity or day and i think it is very good if you use it with discipline and good sense
it 's a really really beautiful city in spain i feel like home i find a lot of people who are very very kind so this is a wonderful wonderful city in this country
during my holidays usually like to watch a lot of movies for example in christmas holidays i really like to watch christmas films classics and news so it 's like a hobby during holidays for me
that 's an interesting question because i have two members in my family that i really like to spend my time with them but my answer is my sister it 's like a second mother to me but i really love her and she is very kind to me i like it
but that 's so interesting because right now i 'm studying business administration so it 's my dream
well in this subject it 's a little bit complicated to give an opinion but at first if the students works to pay their universities it 's very interesting because they can say i can work in whatever they want and they can pay what they really want they do it for their future the disadvantages is also maybe the job it can be a source of stress for the students and if they can work some month or some week for the university they does n't have the incomes that they need to pay her university in my point of view yeah it 's good but it depends about the degree and the economic situation for every student is i do n't know
well traveling by airplane it 's nice but we must pass and for a lot of steps at first we must go to the airport by car train or bus the vehicle that we want then we are in the airport we must go to the desk and do our check in or we can do it online then we must pass by a document control maybe if we need a piece or not it 's not always like that then we pass the security controls with our carry on bags then we have the weight it 's a little bit tired but we must do it then we have the board on the airplane and at the ends we have the departure of our flight it 's wonderful
well nowadays we use a lot of technology to study for example now we have the opportunity to use different kind of technology like ipads or tablets and also our laptops help us to study better and easier and faster
well in my own point of view and in my own experience it 's better it 's better to me because i have good memory when others talk to me and explain me face by face but someone says it is not always like that it depends
it grew projects it 's really complicated sometimes and we develop our passion maybe passion and empathy is the most important attitude that we develop with these kind of projects
to be honest for me it 's useful attending lectures it 's better to me but i know that a lot of people think that it be useful it is awful for them but i think it helps us maybe you can remember something in this kind of activities
i think it 's very very important that universities or schools or any kind of place give us more fatalities to learning because we are in a new era and we must have more access and modern to that information
i live in a wonderful place near a swimming pool and a basketball ground i can play basketball with my friends on weekend or after school and i also can swim with my friends
i enjoy playing basketball with my friends we play basketball around six persons and we divided into two teams we often win this game and that 's a good experience for me and a good relax for weekends
first it can give them money to support them to study for their college fee and it can give them an experience that can have a lot of benefits when they come into real work and if they can not life balance it will have a lot of disadvantage maybe their grades will be affected
if you want to travel by plane you first should travel to the airport you can travel by car bus or train when you come to the airport you need to first check in and document control will control your document and you will go to the security make sure you do n't bring knives and other things that can harm people and after a long time wait you can have some coffee buy some gifts and go to toilet or eat something then you can go abroad that 's all
i think we can use technology to search for some difficult questions that teachers may not answer and we can also use technology to watch some videos about some important questions
yes i think learning from a teacher face to face is the best way because students can learn from a teacher 's movement and get a better understanding and a teacher can get students feedback very quickly and give them answers
i think there are many skills such as leader skills they can lead a team and make everybody do things they like to do and they also can have the skill to cooperate with friends
i think attending a lecture is very important because the speaker of the lecture are also the specialists of the area and they can give you a clear understanding of this area but books you read you ca n't get the point of the writer
i think that 's very important because students can know how to learn from this learning facility and teachers can get feedback very clearly from students from these learning facilities
normally i used to go to the gym or a church as well and spend some time with my family watching some movies walking around the beach for instance yeah
practicing
maybe playing piano
well it depends so it 's an advantage if you consider that they will be more responsible with their own things obviously they have some disadvantages because they will have not so much time maybe to have fun maybe sometimes to evaluate the right situations in school or maybe in the work because sometimes it 's not possible deliver in the best way in both sides but
so from my understanding this image is dealing with axid rain because they have a lot of consequences in our environment because they can damage a lot of the environment so we have some particles that fall as dust and can as well rain or snow and damage the environment so this is a pollution so this is my understanding about this image
it 's very important because water is the best drink that you can use for a daily basis so it 's very important to drink always water in the morning afternoon evening because it will clean our body
yes personally normally i go to gym four times in a week and it 's very important because it 's part of healthy living so
yes i totally agree because sleeping it will have some consequences in our daily basis
now i am living in apartment in the south of bogota with my wife and sometimes other persons or people from my family come to visit me
i really enjoyed watching movies and it 's pop com and doing exercise and missing my family it 's all
i really enjoy spending time with my wife she is very person my the most important person in my life because we share all time
i think that in my future i had two different kinds of things
but the advantage is that the time is very very short and it 's all
okay there are six steps to take a travel in an airplane by airplane it 's very easy the first is travel to airplane the second step is to do checking pass to document control and security after people need to board and after they need to board it 's very important and when the people are traveling by airplane it 's better not to bring our car and maybe travel through april in a bus stop
i agree the technology is a great tool and the story is very
that depends for people it 's easier to learn when the teacher is near
i 'm pretty interested in learning other countries especially the cultural things
i would like to watch some videos movies tv series things like that
i would like to have some conversations with artificial intelligence to practice my speaking english and listening skills
i really wanted to learn the skills of housing especially with artificial intelligence i want to build applications with this technology
well i think one of the advantages must be that they can earn money through those part time jobs that at the same time those jobs may distract them from their studies so they may have full academic performance my opinion is i think those students who have good self control skills can try the part time jobs because for them they can manage their own time they are more advantages than disadvantages to those kids to those students yes
and they can bring acid particles that are in smoke and then the acid particles are carried by wings some of them may fall as dust which can be damaged damaged to environment
eat more fruits vegetables and plants and be definitely not bad food
water is really important to our human body and make sure that it 's not water every day so that you can get away from illness
well in my opinion i think it depends on different people like maybe you know it 's not a good frequency for people to do everyday
in my opinion i think it depends people may need eight hours some people may need less or some people need more i think it just depends on different situations in different people
well i think it 's not a black and white question i think it depends on the people who use the technology like you can use it to help you find great exercise video but
i like the summer because i have a hobby like parachuting skydiving and during the summer it 's better to practice my hobby and it 's also good to eat to sleep so i prefer the summer during the year
i was a very happy child i had time to play by myself and even with my younger sister i have a sister eight years younger than me and she was like my doll i worked a lot and played a lot with her it was a really good time for me
i hope to have a good retirement i would like to have money enough to have a good health care and travel a lot not only inside my country but also out of the country and eat well and see a lot of different things
yes i think that university courses should include a period of practice work experience it 's important to guarantee that students will go to the working time knowing what is waiting for them students can be prepared to be more efficient some disadvantages of this one is that we need to have investments and laboratories and other stuff to guarantee that the work experience will be valid will be enough to support the learning of these students in the real conditions but the quantity of advantages of course is beer if compared with the disadvantage of these kind of stuffs
hey y' all i will do a presentation about people visiting three new online pop site music sites on the graphic below we can see in the blue line the website music now in orange line the site songs for you and in red line the site tunisnet we can see along seven days one week as we can see on the excel bar and we can see a big improvement on the tunisnet on the last days of our checking and we can see a reduction in the other two sites music now and songs for you maybe do it too the changes of the material show it presented on these websites
i think that disagree is a strong word i think that the team members should be encouraged to share his point of view no matter if it 's aligned or not aligned with the remaining members of the team
i do n't think so
i think that it 's a sensible point of view if you are looking for a short time maybe sometimes a guy that 's working alone will have better results
it 's very interesting to learn a new language in different countries of france and it 's a great experience for me
i enjoy my free time when i practice basketball sports and i play video games wins my friends and my family
the best for improve my english will be if i go to country anglophone or i can speak english all day
i wo n't learn english language because it 's a language which offered opportunity in the world and it 's a language the most speak in the world
i think it 's a really really good thing when we are students the first problem is no have n't got experiences when to start a job and i do n't think i have this advantage and this case will be a great experience for all students
in this image i watch how the pollution affects the environment to and some particle acid of pollution which affect all the environment as pollution can be seen in the vehicles and affect all the environment
the most important for the human is drink water so and
sleeping is important for enjoying life all day
the technology can be positive and negative
i 'm really keen on new cultures i 'm from europe so i am familiar with cultures or european cultures that 's the reason why i would love to learn about foreign cultures such as indian culture
during my free time i love visiting museums i think that learning about art and our history can explain our current situation and thanks to living in madrid i can go to several famous museums
nowadays the best way for students to improve their english will be to use artificial intelligence plansforms such as this one can help students to improve the way that they speak write or hit or hear reading skills
if i had the possibility to learn a new skill definitely it would be to learn a new language maybe a language that it seems difficult such as chinese or japanese this kind of language will help us in the future
university students that do part time jobs are better in organizing their schedules or their student time but on the other hand it is difficult to them to focus on their exam so it will be kind of stressful during exam periods to work and study at the same time but i will say that the optimal situation will be maybe to work in a part time job that is related with or your area of studying such as for example if you are studying law will be interesting to work with a lawyer that can help you to understand better your knowledge about law
climate change is one of the biggest challenges that human beings are facing nowadays mainly it 's caused because of pollution pollution that factories emit or produce while they are working or factoring this pollution contains some acid particles that are both in the wind or in the clouds it is important to be aware that this kind of acid particles arrive into our lakes or rivers damaging its species that live there such as octopus or maybe different kinds of fishes but on the other hand due to the acid trace which is in the clouds it can reach for us damaging our trace
my best piece of advice in terms of eating a healthy diet will be to introduce in this diet different types of foods such as bettables cereals fresh meat
drinking water is a habit that really helps your body to maintain the energy that it needs to face the complete routine as a day and it helps your organism to work better
i will say that it depends on the person and lifestyle of that person if you love doing exercise why not doing every day if
the healthiest option is to exactly sleep eight hours per day but there are some studies that shows that sleeping just six or seven hours per day helps as well
positive effect of course i think that thanks to technology we are allowed to do several activities such as for example work for home or taking some pictures about our daily life and also it has improved healthcare systems
i live in a city that is one of the most big in my country
definitely i enjoy my holidays traveling to where is my old family i mean my cousins my grandfather my grandmother and get a good day
i would like to have a job related to engineering or related to simulation for example but i also think that i could have a job with my family for example
all students should get job to pay for their university studies i think the principal advantage of this is related to the students can get some liberal experience but i think that principal disadvantage is related to the time because they lost time that they could use to improve in their studies my opinion is that there are more disadvantage than advantage for get a job being a university student
now i 'm going to tell you about traveling by airplane if you want traveling by airplane you need to travel to the airport then you need to get entered to the facility and after this you have to check in because if you do n't you ca n't fly anywhere after that you will need to pass to the document control security and after wait for hours or maybe a minute you will be able to abort the plane this is all after all of this you can travel in by airplane
the students can use the technology searching advances information for example topics related to university career and this is the way that they can use it
i think if you can get a classes face to face you should get it because classes online also it 's good but i think face to face is better
i think the principal skills that we can develop working together in group project is the effective communication because in this case we will need to solve several problems
attending lectures it could be better for some people because they can get help from their classmates but in my opinion i prefer get reading alone
i think that if we are in university we need to focus in learning facilities abilities because these are the topics that will be important in the future
i 'm very interested in learning new things
i 'd just like to spend my free time according to jean
the best way to improve my english is watch movies and series and talk how they can
our university students should do part time jobs while they are studying the advantage of that is they 're going to be responsible with job and money they learn about their life and the disadvantage of that is they 're going to be less time to application or the course in the university so
in the today days the vehicle produces a lot of pollution and the factories too so this pollution has acid particles in the smoke and some of these acid particles carry by the wind and they mix with cloud and fall like water and it make a rain some as particles fall as dust and pollution the reef is the sea so the solution for that is the electrical vehicles so that 's it thank you all very much
drink water is a must because your body composes seventy five percent water so it 's very important to drink water all day every day
doing exercise is very important to your health conforming to going older it 's very important for your life for everything
i think our people have a sleep at least eight hours every night so they 're gon na be prepared today
i think technology has a negative point on people life because when you spend much time on your computer you do n't do exercise it 's the truth
i want to learn about cultures and languages and food that 's all
in my free time i like to study to watch movies and to cook
it is speaking about things that you like it
i would like to learn all those new languages
the advantages the students will be more prepared for the work market they will be better professionals the disadvantages they will have time less to study but i think it 's important experience that all students to live
the water cycle is influenced for the polluation of factories and vehicles this is very dangerous
i eat fruit and vegetables every day usually i eat fruit and vegetables for morning afternoon and night
the water is very important for health i drink water one every three hours for a day
as water the exercise is very important for health i practice exercise every day
the technology is positive when it 's of correct form
i 'm very interested that 's why i chose chester environmental engineering at the university and i want to be part of the transformation and make the world a better place for everyone
we like to cook special exerts to play games sports and card games for example we like to play volleyball too or just stay there together talking about life and plans
definitely my twin sister we look like each other we have the same style we like to talk about the same things and we laugh about the same jokes so definitely my twin sister
i do n't know exactly but i want to have the opportunity to live on the beach for some time just have the experience to live near the ocean go there feel the vibe and have the experience enjoy there
schools and colleges should make time in the school day for our students to do fitness classes as advantages we can say about the weather and the need to adapt some fitness classes so all of the students can take this class and enjoy the sun and i agree it should be one priority of these schools and colleges
so today i will talk about how honey is produced first of all we collect nectar from flowers then they go to the the behind hives where the bees make honey from this nectar that was collected then beekeepers collect honey from bee hives and puts them into pots that are ready to be sold then this pot goes to the transportation that takes it to the supermarket when people can buy it
they should consider how safe the country is if the country gives resources to students from abroad and how immersed in their culture their students will be and how much you learn
the advantages of studying in a second language is that you can get immersed in a cultured and lifestyle you can learn new things develop new skills and be able to communicate with more people
learn the language and understand the accents and also live far from home can be another difficulty that students can face during this time
i agree because everything depends on them how when they are going to eat what they are going to do to deal with finances
i am very much interested in learning about other countries especially about their culture and the language and everything
i like to listen to music and i enjoy to play guitar and to learn other musical instruments
for me the best way to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people to travel abroad and even better to live abroad
well i would like to learn to play sitar it 's an indian instrument
all students should have part time jobs while they were studying well with it you have some advantages for example they are not worried about how they will pay for the university which is a good thing but on the other side there are some disadvantages for it because they will not be able to concentrate in their studies they do not have enough time to learn the disciplines so in my opinion again they should n't have to work to pay for the graduation in college
well we can see in this picture how the x ray is produced in the right side of the chart you can see the sources of pollution like factories and vehicles that produce pollution this axed particles are in this smoke that go up in the sky and these particles are carried by the wind some of the axed particles fall as dust and other particles mix with the cloud water and then finally these acid particles follow with the rain or the snow so we can see in this diagram how the acid rain is produced and returned to the soil
well the best advice is to choose the right foods
drinking water is very important to our health so ideally you should drink at least two liters of water per day
yes it is fundamental to do exercise every day especially cardio exercises also strength exercises stretch exercises so it is very important to exercise in different ways to improve your health
well i agree that most of people need about eighty hours per day some people a little more but in average a lot of people need eighty hours of his lead per day
i think nowadays technology has a terrible effect in the health of people especially in the spine people take so much time in the mobiles phone with a bad position of the neck so in general technology is bad for the health
i am very interested in learning about other countries
in my free time i enjoy studying english trying to learn something new and trying to speak i want to improve my english
i think practicing a lot is the best way for me to improve my english
if i could learn a new skill it would be speaking english better or speaking other languages like french and german
i think all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying i think there are some advantages for them to earn some money while they are at university and as this is going to use i can say that while working or while doing part time jobs they can not find perhaps enough time to study their own lessons so they may be failed in their studies or in their exams in my opinion each system can arrange their own situation
as you know we got factories to produce smogs and these smogs produce the air in the polluted air there are acid particles and these particles are carried by wind and after some time these asap particles are in form of air or snow fall down to the earth 's surface so they damage the environment
i do n't agree with that because this may be true for children because children need more than eight or ten hours sleep but for an adult for six hours sleep is enough i think
so it 's a positive effect
i think learning in foreign country is a really interesting thing i can expose to foreign culture and see many sides i never seen before
but last weekend i went to the beach to enjoy the sunshine and the sounds of the waves
i think the best way to improve my english is to practice more only practice more can i speak frequently and writing academically
i think math is really important nowadays
the part time jobs have positive and negative effects for university students while they are studying for positive effects they have more opportunity to take responsibility for their tuition and they can make a plan for their money but however the part time job maybe distracts their attention on study and maybe have an active impact on their scores but from my perspective i think some part time jobs maybe benefit for university students
how is a rain created if they are poured into the air by the smoke and then they are carried by the wind some aid particles fall as dust and both the two ways will damage the environment like soils trees and other creatures
you need to eat both meat and vegetables maybe eggs and fruits
it is really important to drink water in a day
i think that eight hours sleeping is a benefit for almost everyone but maybe someone only needs a few hours to refresh their mind and they do n't need eight hours
it is a fairly quiet city where you can go out to party with friends and it is a beautiful city for studies and other things than do sports
during the holy days i really like to do parties go out with my friends in different places and why not in different countries i also like to do sports as basketball
one person of my family who i enjoy spending time is my sister because it 's
in my future i want to be physiotherapist because i 'm studying for this work and it 's my dream to become a physiotherapist
there are many advantages of working to pay your studies first of all it allows us to be autonomous and not to have to always ask parents for help it also allows us to meet new people however the fact of working takes us a lot of time and we can raise this less much which can be an inconvenience during the studies in my opinion it is a good thing to work during the studies because i did it last year but you also have to find time to work on your classes and find time for your family for your girlfriend and for your friends because it 's really important in the life of the university
i go to present the different states what people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all we must travel to the airport and one time we are in the airport we can check in and show your documents for pass the security in the second we can wait in restaurant pass to the toilet and take a cafe and for the film we can board in the plane and go to the destination
i consider technologies as a great advance for the world because it allows us to do a lot of research and make your lives a lot easier however we have to be careful how much time we spend on technologies
studying with a teacher face to face is really enriching because he can explain to us directly if we do n't understand certain things
i think that working in a group is a good thing because it allows us to develop more skills as friendships and allows us to meet people and friends
it is very important to develop learning facilities because it allows students to be more autonomous and to find working methods in order to have good results in the different tests
i live in shanghai shanghai is a bustling metropolis which is famous for its futuristic skylines vibrant culture and its prosperous economy it is also a city with a long history dating back to more than a thousand years before
on my holidays i usually go to dance clubs dancing boosts my muscular strength and flexibility as well as improving my cooperation and balance also during the dancing process i improve my confidence
i would like to spend most of my time with my mother because we are both avid readers and we love to share our different opinions about a book or a piece of knowledge inside it and she always encouraged me to voice my opinion
well i would like to become a diplomat in the future so that i can voice opinions on different issues on behalf of my motherland i know it 's a demanding job and requires effort but i 'll seize any opportunities to improve my ability
there 's no getting away from the fact that more and more students are willing to take a part time job while they study at universities so this kind of phenomenon do have some advantages students seize opportunities to earn incomes and they got a salary for their works which helps their parents save a lot of money this and should be encouraged but yet it has some disadvantages like part time job made distract students from their normal studying process and do some harm to their academic scores so my opinion is that we should balance our work and study in order to develop ourselves while having access to the society
now i 'm going to introduce the steps of traveling by airplane first you should take some transportation to airport you can rather take a bus or drive by car or take an underground after you arrive at the airport next what you should do is to check in that is to say to put a luggage on the plane ahead of time then you went a document control some officials will do some checks in order to ensure security finally after you have passed the check you can enter the waiting room during the waiting time you can choose to go shopping or having a coffee or eat something if you 're feeling packaged finally you can go on board and have a good time
so first technology can offer us a lot of new information
well learning face to face sometimes boosts efficiency and makes me more concentrated on learning itself
there are many advantages and second students can learn a spirit of co operation which is very important in the society
i think attending lectures is sometimes more effective because when you are listening to others ' opinions you will think subjectively and efficiently to judge whether what he said is true or false but when you are reading books you may sometimes just distract
my best way to improve my skill in english is practice in writing and speaking especially with read the book and watch a movie
of course i will be happy for it because i can more effective to communicate with other people and my work
in my opinion doing part time job while they are studying have some advantages and disadvantages the advantages can be given they are responsible to ourselves to themselves and these advantages can interfere with the time to study i think it can be tried but with proportion that is not too much then
how pollution causes acid rain first pollution from factories and vehicles or distributes become acid particle in smoke and then this acid particle are created by wine and some acid particles are as dust and some other acid particles mixed with cold water and become to rain or snow now that rain or snow it can be damaged to environment isbai shi as it is anti vibral
fatty foods
the it does n't need to be heavy but consistent
and i agree to sleeping more than eight hours
but i think technology more good vibes to our hearts because it more help us
i 'm very interested in learning about different countries when i go on vacation i always visit different places i have visited germany japan and vietnam
when i have free time i usually do sports i like playing badminton very much i love playing badminton especially the doubles when i playing with my friends together we always have a lot of fun
i always try to speak with my friends in english and i also take english courses because teachers can correct my errors and i also have opportunities to speak with native speakers
i want to learn how to play the guitar i like guitar sound i think it 's cool to play the guitar while you are singing and it can hit up the atmosphere too so i want to learn this new skill
there are advantages if university students to part time job for example students can gain skills and working experience and they can earn some pocket money if they want to by things like cell phone they can pay it themselves and through the working experience they can be independent on the other hand they may have no time for their studies and it can take longer for their studies too because they do the part time jobs personally i do n't think all university students should do part time jobs
good afternoon everyone it 's my pleasure to give a presentation on xc rind please look at this diagram first we see pollution is from factory and vehicles then xc particles are in smoke next axi particles are carried by wind there are two possibilities here first some axi particles fall as dust other axi particles mix with cloud water after that axi particles are in rain or snow that 's how axi rain is formed axi rain can damage environment that brings to the end of my presentation thank you for your listening
i would suggest that they should have three regular meals every day and they should eat vegetables and fruit as much as possible so that they can get enough vitamin
it 's important to drink a lot of water if you do n't drink enough it 's easier to get dehydrated if the body does n't have enough water you will feel very tired and you have no energy to do anything
basically it 's essential to do exercise every day we do n't need to do very much even twenty minutes that will be okay the most important thing is we keep moving and we live well
i think it depends on people some people need eight hours some people need only five hours so the most important thing is you sleep enough if you sleep enough then you have energy to do anything
i think technology has a negative impact on people 's health because we always overuse the computer or smartphone it can harm our eyes our sight our
i 'm very interested about learning other countries because it can give me an opportunity to study other traditions and cultures and also i can meet other peoples that i can communicate ways to improve my foreign language skills
i enjoy spending my free time with my friends in the school stadium we can play all kinds of sports out there such as ping pong racing and basketball which will make us a healthier body and a fun time
i think the best way for me to improve the english is to read aloud and watch some english movies read aloud will lead me to have good translations and

it is very common that all university students should do part time jobs while they 're studying and there are many advantages for example they can make friends when they are working with each other and they can also under many practical skills which might be used in the near future and as for the disadvantages i think they will find it hard to strike a balance between their part time jobs and their studies and in my opinion i think all university students should do the part time jobs and they will find they can do this to improve their self abilities about working with each other and
hello i 'm giving a presentation of our acid rain firstly there are many cars and factories generate some pollution like smoke and the acid particles are in the smoke as the smoke carried by the wind the acid particules were divided into two parts some acid particules will fall as dust and damage to the lake and other acid particules will mix with cloud waters and then they will contain in the rain or snow and that will do great damage to the environment
well i suggest that they can eat more vegetables and fruits because they contain more nutrients than the meat and junk food and this will lead to a stronger house and stronger bodies
so i think drinking water can keep us alive and give us a clear mind in the daytime you
i think it is quite essential to do exercise every day because this can improve our health and give us a stronger body to connect with each other you can do an exercise with other people who can share the same interests in sport
i think that an 8 - hour sleeping night at night can give us a clear remind in the daytime
well i think technology has a positive impact on people 's health because it can give us some treatment correctly and they can also give some ways to improve our health scientifically
i like to communicate and to know new places that 's why i 'm interested in knowing our culture and our language
going i like to do some sport and to walk and talk to my friends and play and to play with my children
the best way to improve my english is to have a whole immersion in english i want to say i speak every time in english i send a radio or a tv in english and write in english too
i would like to fly like a bird because if you are in the sky flying you can see everything with another point of view that was fantastic and
because like that they can have more money more cash and they depend less from her parents as an example of work of doing the university is that they will have less time to get free time to enjoy the life in my opinion it 's good to have a part time job but not all the time
when the bakers and the factories are working they emit a lot of pollution and emit smoke with particles with contaminant particles that are carried and mixed in the wine and some of them come back to the earth fall down as contamination and the other is mixed with the cloud when it is mixed the particles are mixed in the cloud it produces rain and this water has a lot of acid particles and provokes a damage in the environment
to have a good habit of eating it 's good to eat several kinds of fruits less meat and more bigger tables and less sugar
it is very important to drink water and you need to link water and another drink like soft drinks or alcoholic drinks because they had a lot of sugar
yes it is i do everyday exercise and i think this is a good habit because you wake up your body and you are more healthy
the number of hours to sleep depends on every person each person is different and
but usually nordic is bad because provoked a cemetery life
when i 'm in holiday i like to go out with my family
i used to be with my brother my brother and his family is very enjoyable
speaking about all students should get jobs to pay for their studies one of the advantages could be that they can take experience about working talking about disadvantages i think that if they work maybe they have n't got enough time to study but in my own opinion if they can do both things it is well you
i 'm going to explain how to travel by airplane first we must go to the airport to go to the airport we can go by bus train or car in the airport the first thing that we have to do is the checking once we check in we must pass document control and security and then we have to stay waiting in the waiting area we have toilets shops and cafes so we can eat something after that they will call us to board so then we will go to flight
yes i prefer face to face to technology learnings because face to face the relations are better
in my opinion i like working group projects because we can share different knowledges and we can speak with each other
yes i think that attending lectures is more interesting because the speakers give us their knowledge
to have more learning facilities is interesting for the university because like this the university will go a good and level university
i live in a place that is a big house with a large scale garden
normally i prefer to do some indoor sports such as platties yoga meditation besides that i will pick up a book from my bookshelf to read such as comic books and military books
wow i 'd like to say that it 's my mother because both of us have quite similar personality we are gorgeous confident and
well there are a lot of jobs i would like to do
to say that they can compete with their friends in the near future plus but from
today i 'm going to introduce several steps of traveling by airline first you need travel to airport by the public transportation or your private car after that you need to do the document control by the staff after we check all the details and identify following its security check they might check your personal belongings and your pocket and so done with all the things you might need wait in your correct gate and see it or go to the toilet or shopping finally you might go on board and fly takeoff
for the university students they might use google scholar to do their literature review besides that they might use zoom or teams to consult some questions with their professors and also make an effective conversation with their classmates
it is apparently for the normal students face to face of course guide them to be disciplined and also to be effective but for the students who are genius study alone is a much better way for them
well firstly they will learn how to negotiate and cooperate with other team members in addition they might study how to manage their personality properly because there are many different views in their teams
i have to say it is one hundred percent significant for university to do so because right now the artificial intelligence is very modern and popular among the students if
i 'm very interesting because i want to travel to another countries and meet their culture and traditions and i want to speak with them in this idiom because it 's the most popular language in the world
i used to go with my friends and family to concert museums and maybe go to swim or a coffee shop just to talk on having some fun but most of the time i 'm just in my house
i used to watch movies read in books and listen to music in english and i used to visit pages like this like write and improve and speak and improve to improve my english better
i could choose learn better and faster without any problems and to give any information in my hand and i could share it with others
the advantages are that the students can learn more about their work but at the same time they can win or gain more money while they are studying and the disadvantages are that they did n't have a lot of time to work and studying and they can not balance their job and studying so they need need free time to do a lot of things and in my opinion they need to work and organize their times to work and job to work and study at the same time without any problems and they can learn and improve their job and study time
this is a dimetch two environment as we can see the factories and vehicles create pollution that became in acid particles in the smoke other acid particles mix with clowned winter that fall in rain and snow
i think eating habits are important to improve a healthy life i think that the most important is eating fruits and vegetables that make you feel more comfortable with yourself and your body
it 's very important to drink water because you can clean your body and you need to do it every single day
yes i think do exercise is very important because it makes your body stronger you can do any exercise like swim or football or tennis or any exercise you want but it 's very important to do it always
you need to sleep eight hours per day and if you did n't you 're going to be more weak
yeah i think both are correct technology brings you information that is very important to us to have a healthy life but also you can find fake news that could be dangerous for us
i really interesting environment that in my opinion it 's really important for our future
let 's learn about play video games and see some movies on the scene
i mean my fur is more similar of me and it 's tall same as me and the same skin
i met in madrid spain it 's a really wonderful city
all students classes can and
hi everyone in the first time bees collect nectar from flowers then bees make honey from nectar in beehives and then beekeepers collect honey from beehives then and finally it 's in a supermarket for all consumers
i mean the most important thing to choose a country is the distance between you live on the school or the university and how much you pay for live in here
i mean the cost of the life the culture and the person in other countries usually is different
and i do n't know i mean depends some case of the person is different for someone
the culture and the people it 's important to know how living in other areas for me is nice to know the people
watching b movie and practice with other people in other countries when i had two opportunities to practice with other persons for the job i got it
or maybe the student needs to know the work
the factories start the production and producing the pollutions and these particulars are in the smog after the acid particulate has occurred with by win maybe it 's a miss with the clove persipatations in but
it 's important to eat in habits because the normal person eating bad no vegetables only bad food
yes but never practice as aside every day i try to run in all days but it 's easy for me
yeah every people say about the unit eight hour to sleep but
i think that there are many different reasons for learning about other countries but i think that the main reasons are the language and the culture that you can learn
in my free time i really enjoy reading textbooks about philosophy and about sciences like physics also of course i like to hang out with friends
i would say that the best way to improve my english is speaking with friends and with people that only can speak in english
i definitely would learn to play an instrument i really like the guitar and i would like to perform my favorite songs by pink floyd and other rock groups
well i would say that the advantages are very clear i think that the students that have to work they have more money and in this way they do n't have to depend on their parents the disadvantage i think that is the less time that they have to rest and to hang out and to hang out with friends or something like that in my opinion i would say that each person person have to do what they want in this case i think that it is possible to do the two things at the same time so i do n't see a problem
the first step in the production of the acid rain is the pollution that comes from factories and vehicles in that situation some acid particles fall as dust contaminating lakes and other acid particles mix with clout and fall in form of water damaging the trees and the environment
my advice is that people have to control their diet for
i think that drinking water is fundamental not only for keeping a healthy lifestyle but it is fundamental for the life
obviously i think that it is not essential to do exercise every day but i think that it is very important that you can do exercise the most times that you can
yes i agree with that because sleep is essential to be rested during your day and to perform the best of you in work and with your family
i think that technology have neither positive nor negative consequences in our life i think that all these questions depends on the use of each person do to technology
i 'm very interested
i like to read books
practicing more with the speaker
speak english
actually this is a complicated topic because of course you can find the advantages and disadvantages the advantage is that the student can get some experience in the time that he 's studying but the advantage in my point of view is that maybe this person can lose the focus on the students so this could be complicated and
i do not have a huge experience regarding axe rain however for what i can see on the picture i can understand that the pollution came from the vehicles and the factors it goes up in the air and it could be carried from the wind and so part of these particles will fall as a dust directly in the environment nearby and part of this can be mixed with the cloud waters and then it 's the way where the asteroid is formed so could damage the environment a little bit far than when and it 's carried just as at this
the advice that i can give the people who want to have a better eating habit is that they should increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that they are eating and reduce the amount of sugar
yes i do believe that doing exercise daily is a way to improve your health not just your body health but also your mental health so for me that 's something everyone should do on a daily basis
i think that in my case for example i do n't need eight hours of sleep every night however maybe can exist people who need slayers and i think it 's fine i think that people should sleep as much as they need
i think the technology topkits it 's like depends on the way that people are using technology i mean everything in life needs balance and also the technology
well i 'm pretty interested about learning about other countries about different cultures and the different traditions that they have there
i do n't have that much of a free time but i would like to spend it with my friends and family loved ones in general and i really like to you know read books and that 's it
and also i would say watching movies and tv series really helps me to improve my english and also reading books and helps me watching different videos on youtube
i would really like to play a new instrument i play two instruments right now and i 'd like to start a new one it 's a persian traditional instrument
well the advantages of students working is that they could have an extra money for what they need and it will help them with the money but the disadvantages are that they would have less time for example doing their homeworks or they would be tired in the end of the day and they will have less energy to do their homeworks and study for the university in
well this is a diagram how factories and vehicles can cause damage to environments first of all they make this pollution which has acid particles in this smoke and the wind can carry these acid particles through the air and some of these particles fall down as dust and may pollute the water and some other will go through the clouds and will make acidic water which comes down to the ground as rain or snow
i would definitely say people that do not skip the breakfast do not start your day without eating your breakfast and also i could say that it 's more fruits and vegetables and also less sugar
well it 's really important to drink enough water because it really affects our body and our brain especially when you 're going to drink a glass of water in the morning because you wake up really dehydrated after your sleep
well doing exercises is really important but i do n't think that it 's necessary to do it every day but it would be really nice if you take exercises like three days a week or more or less how much you can in your lifestyle
well i agree with them scientific research shows that it 's really necessary for our brain to take that sleep overnight it 's really necessary for its function
i ca n't give you a firm answer like yes or no but technology has effects our lifestyles in many ways it has some benefits and some disadvantages you should know how to manage it
i 'm really interested because i would like to travel for some months and it 's important for me to know languages to know another cultures and what is important for the other countries
in my free time i usually play guitar or piano and also like to reading books and another important activity is to walk and running with my dog
so it 's important to know their expressions or what they talk
i would like to learn about chemistry i think it 's important to know about what happened around us
to have a part time job while you 're studying can have some advantage like for example with that salary you can pay your studies or for example your future studies but also that can have a lot of disadvantage like for example you can have enough time to do homework or you can have enough time to spend with family or with friends or for example to do another kind of activities you can have focus in studying and maybe you ca n't lose the opportunity of starting
that pollution can turn in acid particles and are in the air these particles travel in the air and in the wind and can convert in acid particles that fall in the dust or another kind of particles that can be in the snow and the rain that kind of particles can fall in the forest and damage the environment
some of us is that i can tell you are avoiding fast foods and you can eat another kind of foods like for example baked stables fruits that can have a good percentage of water in it
well we 're a great percent of weather in our bodies so it 's important that our body is hydrated due to different activities around the day
not every day i think that doing exercise some days are essential to have a healthiest life as time because the muscles need to move man
i think that the sleepiness is necessary if i do n't know because you 're feel tired all the day
well in a positive way i can say that industries are developing all the time new machines and new technology for health
for currently i 'm living in the home of our university which is for two people in the room and currently i just live near my university which is really convenient for me to go to school and take the class and also it 's very convenient to go to work
i 'm just spending time with my boyfriend during my weekend and weekdays because he is a really good man which is keeping me really relaxed during his life and also i 'd like to say that he 's the best one
be a banker in the investment bank which have a high salary and also working in the cbd which i admire a lot
many students get jobs to pay for their university studies and the advantage of this is that if they join these activities they can improve their work experience and they can get a much great position if they graduate from school and join the work and the other advantage is that if they take part in these activities they can have to earn a lot of money and it can ease the attention in finance so they can take more attention to their subject and the disadvantage is that if they spend a lot of money in getting their jobs it will have a less time to join their subjects and work on their majorities and in my opinion it 's not good to get jobs to pay for their university studies because you can keep them from having a good study
you should travel to the airport by car by bus or by underground and you should get to the departure center and check in if you see the assistant and the next step is that you can wait in the departure center there are coffee cafe and shopping center also toilet and restaurant i included in it and when you hear the announcement on board you should go to gate and boarded airplane and the next step you can leave
i consider learning to teach face to face is the best way because they can communicate with the other people face to face and they can learn their gesture and also facial expressions
they can learn to express themselves on facial expression and also the body gestures
i think that it 's of great importance to build learning facilities because it can make the students to use the learning facilities and enrich their experience on themselves which can help them to work better after graduation
i am very interested to learn about other countries
watching series and search about how i can learn english very well
practicing and speaking to another one watching the series with this subtitle english and learning a new vocabulary and talking to people and listening everything in english
the advantages of part time jobs for students while they are studying they can have money to collect the fees of their university this advantage is they ca n't have time enough to study but my opinion they should have a work time job to have new experience and money money to sponsor their studies
i will talk about acidrein then this will carry by wind then some acid particles full particles fall as dust and the other asset particles mix with cloud water then this asset will in rain or snow when this come in the earth it will the damage to environment that 's it
my advice is they should search for a healthy food and they take it in the fridge on all the time so he will have healthy eating habits
it 's very important to drink a lot of water to their body and their skin to have a healthy lifestyle the water is very important i think
in my opinion not important to doing exercise every day it 's enough to doing exercise three days in the week that 's my opinion
i agree with that opinion because our bodies need eight hours in the day to wake up in the morning with a healthy body
i think technology is generally a positive effect of people 's health because they can use it to effect their lifestyle to make it more healthy
it is in the province of buenos aires in argentina
i enjoy swimming walking on the beach or walking around the mountains or sometimes i read or take a walk around the city
this is my wife of course
i would like to be a developer i am studying for this in a course by my computer
the advantage are you acquire experience you earn your own money and you know the real world the experience is for me very important in this step of your life the disadvantage days are that you have less time to study you can feel tired to do both studying and working and you have more responsibilities in my opinion it 's positive because it is a transition from another way of life it is useful to find a job when you finish your career i think you have to do this
well the first thing you have to do when you 're traveling by airplane is to go to the air station by taxi or a bus or train you have to check in at the customer office and give the ticket it then you have to pass immigration you have to show your document and then pass the security port they check all your bus or you have to put on then you have to wait for the departure at the gate they are indicated to do and then board the plane and make a flight
students can use technology to look up for articles on news discoveries about their study it 's useful to do it
i think so face to face is the logical way to study and the teacher can correct you at the moment and they can find the way you study better
working on a group project is how you work in real life and you have to develop some part of the project it 's how to acquire more information and it 's better for you
i think reading along is better because you ca n't really read what you are reading and you can investigate in the web what are you reading
it 's very important today because facilities are improving day by day and you have to know the new technologies for learning
i am very much interested about learning other countries
i enjoy my free time by watching netflix
i want to speak as much as i can so that i can improve my english
i want to do masters in english literature so that i can speak and listen and write very well and even i can teach other people
according to me university students should do part time jobs while they are studying but they do n't want to do part time jobs and the advantages are they can save more money for their future and for their future studies and sometimes there are disadvantages because they do n't find much time to get their studies and in my opinion doing a job with studying is very much beneficial and it also motivates the student and also boosts up the student 's level and she or she feels more independent
according to me as we can see acid rain is very much dangerous because it causes the air pollution through the vehicles and you can see some of the acid particles are carried away in the smoke and and so it is very bad in nature
like they have to avoid that and
drinking lots of water increases the immunity even skin it glows the skin and you can feel very much energetic and it will also maintain your water level in your body so a drinking water is very beneficial to one health
yes it is very much essential to do some basic exercises because by doing some kind of fitting exercises anyone can feel energetic happy and the body will be flexible all the day
yes according to me also sleeping eight hours is a very good hobby or it 's a very good thing and everyone should take this sleep at
technology always is a good thing because we are knowing about the different technologies we are increasing our economical growth also and through technologies we can easily talk to each other so it 's a good thing but if it is used in a good manner
well i install it by culture and language and traditions and people in general
well really like it watch movies or series i like the k dramas like k series and sometimes read books
we 'll actually watch movies or series in english for practice and
i will like someday to speak korean but i need to learn english first because most of the materials are in english so i need to learn english
first of all i think that i am an expert in this topic because i have a friend who do part time jobs and she is a student right now so what difficult is to do part time jobs where you 're a student and i think that one advantage is that you have more money for pay your studies but what are the disadvantages that you do n't have enough time to focus on your studies so it 's difficult and in my opinion i think that it 's not a good idea to find or search partangels while you are a student because you have to focus on your studies right now
the pollution is a serious problem in our work and the worst part is that we are part of this because all the pollution begin in the factories or vehicles if so they have two steps one of them is some acid particles fall as adults over lakes and seas and other acid particles meets with cold water and acid particles are rain or snow and they are so evil for our planet
actually i 'm not the right person to give advice of eating habits to other people because i think that i do n't have good habits with the food but i think that one of the points is that you eat balance it good
it 's very very important to drink water all of day because our brain needs water to work good so
well i think not every day because it 's too much there yeah it 's important to exercise some days of the weekend like the three or two or four days on the week i
i think that it 's fifty fifty because technology has good things but i think that have bad things too so
it could be a good plan for me maybe in the future
i enjoy spending my free time reading i like reading novels especially i like to visit my parents and spending my time with my family hanging out with friends and maybe watching some series and listening to music
the best way for me to improve my english is reading i think reading to listen in is a good way to watching some series and obviously like trying to do this speaking with a different person even when it 's a robot
it would be painting i love painting frames but i 'm not as good as an artist but i like the different colors painting i would love to do it and improve the skills i think it 's artistic it could be an excellent skill to have
as my point of view the advantage for students doing part time jobs is that they have their money to do many things or maybe buy commodities i do n't know what to pay in that that is important because you know that students most of the time are running out of money and they need to buy their own clothes or maybe things that they need the disadvantage is that they are worrying about many things like working produce money doing many things and not investing time and preparing themselves to maybe get that degree or something related to that that is my opinion but i think it 's important to get experience that is a really important part thank you
this is my presentation about acid rain and at the beginning acid rain is produced by factories and vehicles and the wind moves or these acid particles are carried by wind some of this fall as a dust and others mix with water in the cloud water for example and the situation of this is this acid rain move over the war and the atmosphere that it moves with the wind for example and then get down as rain you know or snow and that could be damaged the environment that is the situation
thinking and what they are eating is the most important you know like the quantity of food is important to create this kind of healthy habit
it 's really important as far as i know people would drink two liters of water per day i do n't like drinking too much water but i know that it 's necessary to moisturize your skin and everything
as my point of view doing exercise will be enough like three times per week according with many specialises that will be good for your muscles and to keep moving your body it will be good sorry just that
i think that is correct you have to sleep at least eight hours as an adult person because that is the moment that your body recovery from many things even some ills or maybe stress are produced by people do n't sleep very well
i think it could be both you know for that will be good but for the other side would be negative
i enjoy reading i enjoy watching tv series and thinking in my free time
nowadays universities should do part time chores while they study they are learning their own lessons the advantages are students have many to do students
today i would like to talk about acid rain becoming an acid rain first the acid rain is become from pollution some particle for a dust and other asus particle mix with clouds water and then asus particle in rain is slow so particle in the fell or there are avalanche and the trees and the trees and the ever miss or the damage
all drinking water is more by chance in our life drinking water is more important to our life i to
doing exercise is good if you do n't do exercise you can have healthy health
everyone is sleeping you should eat seven hours or eight hours in a day
the technology has pros and cons that
i have always enjoyed playing football however now i am thinking of taking up volleyball ball in holidays
i like spending time with my sister because it is similar to me we always play football together and we have a great time together
in the future i would like to be an auditor because i study business i am a lover of business so i think it could be my dream job
it is a good question and it has got a lot of advantages for example they can earn money to spend in their activities or hobbies they can be able to work furthermore we can know all about this job in spite of that they could lose a lot of time furthermore they could n't be able to study or they would have any free time for this reason i believe that parents must pay their university studies to their children because i think it has got this obligation
hi we first of all we to travel to airport by car or by bus or by train when we arrive in the airport we must do the checking we must show the control to the police and suddenly we must to pass the control of the security it
students could use technology in different ways for example they can share a lot of information to study
i love working in a group project because we can learn how to work in chain furthermore we can improve our relationship with our classmates in
it is a good question but i believe that it is depending on the person on the one hand some people prefer attending lectures on the other hand some people prefer to read alone
i think that school with modern facilities the students will learn more faster than other schools without these facilities this
i love traveling and learning new things so maybe a hundred percent i 'd say
i also write blogs and articles
i need to be surrounded with english such as reading or listening and also speaking in english
definitely my communication skill because i 'm quite insecure about my speaking skills so i want to improve that in especially my english speaking skill
i have nothing against university students doing part time jobs actually it 's very good for them and and yeah disadvantages of course most of them does n't have enough time to study or to sleep and to rest well so in my own opinion it 's like ninety percent advantage and ten percent this advantage
smokes from vehicles and factories are the most common factors or contributors to air pollution and in the smokes there are acid particles and of course when it is carried by the wind some of the acid particles fall as test and it also contributes to the pollution to the environment and and that is how acid rain created
people who want to develop eating habits should first have a self discipline and be consistent with their plan about eating healthy foods avoid eating salty foods junk foods and try eating more vegetables especially the green ones
drinking lots of water gives us a lot of benefits it 's very beneficial to our body because it cleanses the toxins and unnecessary toxins in our body
most of the people does n't have time to exercise every day regularly but doing exercise more frequently can help our body to become strong and our bones to be more strong and flexible
eight hours of sleep every night is actually a good sleep thoughts day
it really depends on the usage of technology because nowadays technology is also used in medication purposes
i am so interested because travel is one of my favorite hobbies
in my free time i usually practice sports and during the weekend i go out with my friends sometimes to the cinema or sometimes having dinner
hair i think that it 's a strange thing that i have n't got this type of hair and i ca n't cut it
the advantage of half part time is that you do n't depend on the money your parents give to you another disadvantage is that you have less time to study or do things of the impression but
and acid particles are in air and we move them so
i have this
water is the only drink people must drink so as much water as you drink better with health
in my personal case i practice sport five or six days at week so if i wear them i will do at least three or four times a week
i think that is an amount that is unbelievable in my case i sleep from six to seven hours and i rest so hours
i think that in a balance because it has its big things worse things for example check phone in
on holidays i like to spend my time on running and making some cuisines and cleaning my rooms and washing in a laundry
it 's a difficult question i but mostly my wife is a person that i love to spend with
and that 's it
okay let me explain the all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies and second one and the disadvantages of those activities is to lose their time to study in university so every student have to do their jobs for some extent to pay for their university studies say at least partially not everything
so first you have to do is to travel to airport by car or bus or public transportation to reach the airport after getting to airport you have to to counter to check in the table and and then going to security to your handbags and i think after security you are going to wait for some minutes or some hours before boarding the plane and after boarding the train the plane will go to your destination
in order to be more effective to learn to study the technology can help
i agree the opinion too
i think the communication skills and the motivation skills will be developed through co group projects
in my opinion attending lectures are important and more effective for studying because being attending in the lectures you can communicate with teachers and your colleagues in the class
i enjoy the play with my song and watch tv or see the social networks and story english
i think the best way is to practice every day the language grammar and listening to the videos in english
i think the advantage is about the responsibilities because the students development new skills and the works in my opinion it is n't necessary the students and learning and equilibrating both areas students and jobs because i have experience in the work by students
the environmental pollution are consequently about the different pollution source as a factory bicycles and the humans the pollution produces acic rain and that is consequently the acic particulate in the acetylene affect the plants water and the quality life of the humans the animals and other species in the earth
i think the workout is fundamental for the haiti living but i think the body needs rest sometimes but the doing exercise is important
i think that it is true but sometimes it is difficult to keep all the seven and eight hours and nine but it is true
and depends on the use and but fundamentally is positive
i am very very nervous at learning about all the countries and cultures
in my free time i like to watch movies read some books go to the beach go to the park with my daughters
i think the best way to improve my english is speaking and learning and all about the grammar and trying to speak with other persons
at this moment i 'm trying to learn to be a pilot
in my opinion there is no disadvantages in working part time while studying in university
to begin with we can see in these pictures vehicles and factories emitting carbon dioxide causing pollution and emitting acid particles in smoke these acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles go down as dust and other as the particles mix with cloud water then as the particles goes down in rain or snow and causes damage to the environment
for the people who wants to develop good habits about eating the first thing to do is forgetting the junk food it is the worst thing to the human body
it is very very important to drink water all day long because our body systems needs water to work in a correct way
of course doing exercise is very important for maintaining the health of your body but doing exercise every day could be very difficult for some people
there is no magic number of time of sleeping every day what you have to think is each one have your personal time to sleep and feel healthy in the next day
there are many ways to think about this question in one way the technology has improved the healthy treatments
i find it very interesting to know about their cultures or their architecture and i enjoy to travel to other countries

this is a presentation about an actual issue that is the formation of acid rain it is caused by vehicles or factories then in the tree step these acid particles are carried by wind and in this part we have two options first some acid particles fall as dust but other particles mix with cold water therefore these acid particles are in rain or snow and it causes damage to our environment this is an important issue and actually is the most important
in my opinion having a good lifestyle starts signs or eating habits so personally i could say that consult with a specialist is the best way to start with these good eating habits and
as far as i know experts recommend that in our daily routine we should drink a minimum of two water littles
yeah in my opinion the exercise is the best way to keep it healthy doing exercise has a lot of advantages such as lost mass as well as keep a good lifestyle
as far as i know experts recommend that have about six to eight hours to sleep is a no
in my opinion currently the technology has been part of our daily routine so personally i would like to say that technology has a positive effect in the society to develop
i like to play some games i like to watch movies i like go to the gym and
but the one of disadvantages is about time you do n't have much time to dedicated yourself for studying and improve yourself you know and my personal opinion about it is you do n't need to do part time jobs you know i think way is focus in the students
hey everyone i will go ahead with my presentation about ease the rain and i will show the diagram about it the first one starts with pollution this pollution get from viocus and factors and then the particles is from pollution and then is car heat by white and it damaged out environment
a good advice about eating diabetes is to transform your own life it 's more health and consequently the life is good because eating diabetes is essential for your own life
absolutely doing exercises every day is essential for humans it 's the same for eating and drinking other programically but doing exercises is one of the most important things to do in all of life
i think technolish is a good ally because they 're helping us to do great things like drink doing sleeping and exercising for a good health lifestyle you know but i think it 's good
i think that the environment is the most important thing in the world and i always participate in some activities to protect our environment
on the weekend we enjoyed playing badminton together because this sport not only strength our bodies but also we will have a good time there and i have a good command of playing badminton
i think it 's my mom we both have two big eyes and not only the outlook but also we are very friendly and patient to do everything
i want to live in hong kong in the future because hong kong is an open and inclusive city and i will get a well paid job there
now i 'm going to talk about the students do fitness classes in the college but these advantages are obviously two first some students may not fit for their fitness classes because they have a weak body and then they will get hurt in the fitness classes so in my opinion i recommend the fitness classes in the colleges because nowadays the students need to get more and more exercise in their school
today i 'm going to talk about how honey is produced first of all the bees collect nectar from flowers then in the beehives the bees make honey from nectar together when the honey is full the beekeepers will collect honey from beehives then the beekeepers will pull the honey into bottles then after that there are some vehicles that transform the bottles of honey to the shops finally the shops will give them price and put them into the case so we can buy them
in my opinion they should consider about the faith when studying abroad and the conception level because the money is the most important thing and the local different culture is important too
i think having a good command of second language will help you have a better communication with other people in their countries and when you are in different countries you will speak easily to other people
in my opinion i think the most difficult thing is the local language because it is not the mother language for most students studying abroad and the second one is the local different culture it 's very different from us
i think they can learn the local culture by reading some books about the local histories and they will also go to the internet and search some information about the history
i agree with that because when you study abroad just yourself you will learn many life skills which can help you become more independent and you will not depend too much on your parents for money and something else
i think the best way to learn english is by listening broadway musicals it is important to listen music but i think broadway musicals can use difficult structures that you can emit or mimic them so you can improve it and
think that i would like to learn how to drive because in my town there 's a lot of traffic so it is difficult to move on to one place to another one so for example i 'm not ready to work for that reason because i 'm replace this and
i think that part time jobs are a good idea where students from university could learn new skills that they could n't learn in the school so for example i think some key areas of those advantages are you could talk better and you have confidence when you have a presentation for other parts some disadvantages is that you are more busy and you do n't have time to spend with your free time or you can spend with social things but in my opinion i think that it 's important to have a balance in your life
the smoke of those gases could be mixed with acid particles and those acid particles can be carried by the wind and that in the wind the particles can fall as a dust and other ones could be mixed with the cloud and the clouds are water i could say that but the the dread part of that is mixed with the clouds is that it 's cause the rain and the snow cool falling as an acid rain and
i am not a neutralogist but i could tell you that it 's important to have a balance when you 're eating you have to eat meat fish or something that can bring you protein and you also have to eat fruits and vegetables and for friendly you have to eat of different colors
i am not sure at all but i think that the minimum that you must have to drink is three liters of water but if you are a sports trainer you must have to drink more than three liters of water because it will affect your brain or your training if you do n't drink it
i think that it 's important to make exercise and also it 's important to organize your schedule for example you have to do minimum three hours per week
that 's true it 's important to sleep eight hours but
i do n't think that technology is a problem but some people think that it is because you must have to organize your schedule also when you 're sleeping or doing exercise
exactly interested in learning about our other countries
washing the movie
speaking with native speaker who can correct my mistake
all university students and they should do part time jobs and why they are studying what are the advantage or disadvantages and what is your own opinion yeah advantages is that they can answer for that they are unique fees and that they are welfare and and my own opinions and they can do the part time jobs and why they are studying hard work more
these acid particles are in the smoke and then they have been in the sky by the wind and the acid particles are carried by the winds dusk and so we need to review the factories and vehicles pollution
for good eating habits and then they need to eat and healthy food and not fast food and it contains a lot of salts and a fat and they need to avoid it
of course during the exercise and every day at least half an hour to an hour is quite important for the human body and
yeah eight hours and sleeping at times is essential for every human being and they can have a sound sleep and they can restore their energy and their refresh for the next days and their physical exercise or the mental
besides it has a review since i live near a hot lake with animals such as dogs turtles and fish
as soon as i 'm on vacation i take a break and i was about to the beach with my family it 's wonderful to have quality time with your loved ones also i really enjoy swimming in the sea
i love to hang out with her because i like to teach her new things besides we love animals i hope that in the future she and i have the same relationship
after finishing my degree in biotechnology i would like to work in a laboratory or in research centers
i will talk about a special topic the topic is all students shall get jobs to pay for their university students well from a point of view this has many advantages the students become more independent about the disadvantages maybe the students do n't have time for other activities for it 's okay for a good reason from my point of view in my opinion i think it 's a good opportunity for all the students it 's great
first of you need a transport to travel to airport for example in taxi in car on train on bus i do n't know the important thing is that you are right to airplane then the employee is going to check in your passport and other men is going to check your document this is for security and control after that you must go in a cell while you 're white you can drink a coffee eat go to the bathroom pass the time you 're going to work the airplane
currently the technology is part of the life because with technology you can learn about different topics and
well in my point of view i think it 's the best way to learn for me face to face is
what i 'm just speaking is the advantages
yeah of course attending
i am really interested in other countries and each country has their own pieces of food or buildings and i think it 's so interesting
i like to play video games meet with friends
the best way to improve your english is to practice a lot
i would like to learn about karate it 's a really interesting sport and can help you in difficult situations where you need to defend yourself
working while studying it 's a common decision every student has to deal with one 's time at least in its life on the one hand paying your university degree can be very expensive and that 's why working while studying could be really useful for people but on the other hand it could take too much time and you could not have enough time to prepare correctly your exams so i think the most important is to prepare your studies correctly and leave your work for later in the future
nowadays air pollution is such a very important problem in our society and the smoke they produce contains acid particles that are spread by the wind then some of them fail and contaminate our lakes and rivers and some others mix with cloud water and at raining time they fall to our forests damaging our environment
my advice is to reduce the consumption of fast food and start to eat five meals per day it is very important to obtain strength to your bodies
it is very important to drink a lot of water our bodies are composed about ninety percent of water so we need to drink a lot in order to be healthy
absolutely doing exercise every day reduces our possibilities of having a disease and makes us gain some strength and exercise our bodies
it is very very important to sleep eight hours every day our bodies need to rest too much time in order to be able to do its best on our daily life
that is a difficult question on the one hand it has improved our lives making us able to communicate in every situation
it is quite awesome so it is quite peaceful here
i have got three daughters
i would like to be a teacher because i like spending time with children and
all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies there are some advantages in this secondly they will get some experience which will help them in their future career on the other hand they will spend some time on their work as a result they will have less time for their studies in my opinion it is quite a good idea for students to get a job to pay for their university studies because they will be more experienced
i have been asked to give the presentation about traveling by airplane so look at this diagram to start with go to check in where your luggage will be weighted and you will have the boarding pass then go to the document control and to the security if you have done all of this and you have time so wait in the cafe or go to the restroom or go to the duty free to buy the presents after that go to border and enjoy your flight
to study mike effectively students can use technology they can search additional information and also they can read different researches about this topic
i think that students can develop cooperation and communication when working together on group project because they study to listen each other
i do n't think that attending lectures is more useful than learning alone you can do this online by yourself and it will be so good as attending lectures if you do it responsibly
i think that it is very important to provide modern learning facilities in the universities because nowadays in the world of high improved technology it is so important to have the modern techniques
about culture language and food i am interested in
i 'm spending my free time to do some exercise or to read some books for example i like it
first of all the infography shows us about acid rind for and then the wind transports these particles inside the clouds polluting them and then when rain or snow the particles in rain or snow fell fall throw trees
for me it is very important to shoot to drink water more or less two or three litres for a day
in my opinion it 's very important to do exercise every day perhaps one day to rest but to do exercise more or less six days is very important
i think i agree with the question it 's very important to sleep more or less eight hours at night for this reason your body is better
i 'm really interested to learn about canada because i moved to canada a few years ago and here i have a lot of multicultural people and i 'd like to learn a little about each one and
i enjoy spending my free time making some cookies and cakes i 'd like to cook a lot and i 'd like it to go shopping and i 'd like to walking too so
for me the best way to improve by english is studying a lot i study every single day and about to improve my speaking i think i need to speak every time it 's the best way to improve
if i could learn a new skill i think it will be language i started to study english because i moved to canada for a few years and i needed to speak english and i have a passion for language now
all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because they gain experience but they have some disadvantages because they do n't have much time to study more
this is the ring of course because a lot of factories and vehicles emit some gas gases and this will form acid particles in smoke and it transform in acid particles and carried by wind and some acid particles falls as dust and others acid particles mixed with clouds cloud water acid
it 's very important to drink a lot of water because our body is composed by seven percent of water so you need to drink water to entertain your body it 's very important to have a good health
yes it 's really important to do an exercise every single day it 's
some researches prove that it 's very important to sleep at least eight hours per day
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries because they have different culture and different customs and i think it 's very helpful to know it and practice their customs
some days i spend my time reading books and watching series and anime and this because that refers me my vocabulary in english spanish and japanese
i import my english make many exercises and do the homework read different texts like amazons and books and watch serios
and you can communicate the feelings or thoughts you take and
all university students should do part time jobs well it 's a big discussion because the admissions are many some of them are the student will have extra money and experience about their job so they can be responsible and honest but the disadvantage of this they do n't have enough time to study their exams and do the homework in my opinion if you do n't have enough time it 's necessary to organize it and try to do work try to give the best of you it 's the best answer in your life the student
this is because the factors in bicolch produce pollution in so one group formed the mix with closed water in the other groups fallows dust the clouds rained over the environment and that causes deteriorated the life in that area and produced contamination
you have to have a good eating habit you need to separate your hours in the day and go to the nutrition or doctor they give you the best plan of this and will help you
our body is important to drink water because our body consists of seventy percent of water and if you need a healthy lifestyle life you need to drink more water
maybe one person sleeps for five hours and the other seven hours
things in access it 's bad but if you want to use the technology of your site it 's good
i 'm very interested about learning other countries especially angolan the united kingdom
i spend my free time reading cycling doing spinning going to the mountains
i need to improve my speaking in english so i am trying to use speaking in apbs
i 'd like to improve my speaking english
well i am going to talk about if all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying or not well one of the advantages of work do a part time job while you are studying if you can earn money if you can help your fathers or the people who are earning your studies
well i 'm going to try to explain how the pollution from the factories and the vehicles causes damage to the environment well
well i think we should eat all kind of foods we should eat no much fats and no much sweets
drinking water is very important to be correctly irritated so we should drink water regularly during the day
well i think we should do exercise regularly i do n't think every day but i think twice a week or three times a week or more
i think sleep seven or eight hours a day is very important to be hiddly
i think technology is bad or is good for people it depends on the used people of technology we
i am very interested in the environment and in keeping it in the best conditions as possible
we love thrifting and we also love going to get a little drink while we thrift it 's very fun because you can find the most amazing pieces ever and they 're also unique and we also love just sitting down and just enjoying our time in a park just chatting and keeping up with everything
likewise i think my little sister will look very similar like some people really think that she 's my daughter but personality wise i would say my older younger sister yeah
actually i would love to live in the uk for a couple of years and then come back home yeah i truly love spain so
i would say yes i personally agree with that statement i think the advantages of that is that if there 's students that have no time after school to do any type of support they get an opportunity to finally be able to exercise throughout the day plus it 's also very good for students health also the disadvantages i do n't know i think that unless somebody has like some sort of physical difficulty that 's the only disadvantage i see and in my opinion i think that that 's great and i think that should be done more i
this diagram shows how honey is produced in the first step bees collect nectar from flowers that they find nearby and after that they go to their beehives and they make honey from that nectar that they 've gathered after a while of gathering and transforming it into honey beekeepers collect the honey and they print the joys and then they ship it to supermarkets where it 's sold to everyone to enjoy
what they should consider is i would say the cost of living because if they have enough money to just live without working they would have to find a place that 's low key cheap so they do n't have to work and study at the same time
if you studied in a second language you learned that language and i think it 's easier and i 've always done it so yeah
i think what they might find difficult might be the language if they do n't speak it very fluently or maybe making friends or adapting to the country
they can learn it when they 're going outside with friends to like clubs or if they just visit museums or historical sites or just a simple and nice restaurant where they serve local food that 's also a very great place where you can learn about the local culture
i think it 's true because it gives you the freedom of doing whatever you like and if you make mistakes there is n't really somebody from your family that could help you so it just makes you grow up as a person even if you do n't want to
i am very interesting
i spend my free time studying english spanish and planning travel around the world
speak to with another people
and so i agree and support this option
at first the factories produces more pollution and this cause acid particles are in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wine and the wine gets some particles fall as dust and others can mix cloud water and this process form an acid rain and this damage to environment
so i think the healthy living is a hard process but i can do this for discipline and share with others that can do this too
water can help you to think more in clarity and sleep more healthy too so drink water that can be hard but that is so important
it depends on the situation but i think that so much really really important doing exercises but not every day
have a great quality of sleeping is most important but eight hours for a day is hard the next video
that 's a really good question this is amazing and incredible city all the summers is crowded by foreign people but in winter is peaceful this has a lot of paltries
well that 's an interesting question when i 'm on holidays i always work for hermione and i 'm crazy about playing volleyball with my friends at the beach
well in the future i would like to work like a nurse in london because i think here in spain there are bad conditions and in london the conditions are better i
well from my point of view i think there are some advantages to work as a writer for example while you are studying but i think that there are more disadvantages than advantages for example if you are working you do n't have much time from yourself and from your family or your pet even your friends
i 'm going to explain what you need to do to travel by airplane first of all you need to go to the airport you can go by car by bus or by train and you can call some of your family or your friend to transport you to the airport when you arrive to the airport after this you need to check in in the airport later you should pass the document control this is the more difficult task in the airport because there are a lot of people so
from my point of view studying face to face is better than studying with the technology because
as far as i 'm concerned attending lectures alone is better than other people because you ca n't concentrate on your own better
i think if the university support learning facility to the students they could be half a great favor to a student because the university
i 'm quite interested because i use my english for everyday tasks in my job i have to work with people from different countries from europe so that 's why i need to use my english in my job time so it 's important for me
i especially enjoy my free time going out with my friends because what i hate the most is the loneliness i can not imagine my last days of my life alone
as i said before i have to use my english in my job times so that 's the best way of improving my english is practicing my projects because i have to work with people from different countries in europe so i have to improve my english
i 'm sure that it would be learning in chinese because when i had to look for data sheets of products that are sold in china maybe you have to contact chinese people and
i 'm quite sure that students doing part time jobs while they are studying have more pros than cons because in lifestyle we have to spend a lot of our time on a lifetime working so it 's better to understand how enterprises work so homeworks
hello everybody i 'm here to talk about acid rain cycle this cycle begins in factories and vehicles producing pollution when they are working so they create smoke and these acid particles are inside this smoke so that goes up to the sky and creates some clouds and mixed with water so when they move these clouds to the forest or to the rural areas and that starts raining that particles goes down with the water and they produce some damages to the environment especially trees and water inside the lakes so
i would tell them to create a good schedule for your meals especially when your day starts you have to eat good sugar and some fat because you need energy for your daytime
according to my opinion i think everybody should do exercise everyday because the jobs right now nowadays are very boring so we are stuck in our chairs and in front of computers
i disagree with this opinion because i think that not everybody needs the same amount of sleeping time because for example i only need seven hours to stay good for my daytime and not eight hours as i need it
but right now using augmented reality or something like that you can use technology to keep on moving
i am extremely interested in learning about other countries
well i think there are different ways to improve my english through watching videos through writing on websites and through daily reading
okay if i had the chance to learn a new skill i would go for learning cooking because i think it helps me in different ways like in my real life and yeah
okay first of all let me talk about advantages when students do part time jobs they will have enough money they earn enough money for their studies and they can earn enough money for things they can buy and they will also get familiar with responsibilities they knows how to be a responsible person when doing part time jobs and this also prepares them for their life as well however there are some disadvantages for part time jobs as well first of all the students will not have enough time for their study and for their leisure time and personally i think part time jobs are necessary since it prepares students for their life
okay talking about the diagram we can come to this conclusion that acid rain are exceedingly dangerous for the rain environment and it is because of the pollution for and in some parts it falls down to the rivers again and the rest of it is carried to the clouds which eventually becomes water and it runs into the environment or into the ground and it damages the ground because it is polluted and it is not safe for the environment
okay i think they need to have a very healthy eating habits like they need to include some vegetables fruits and some you know low fat food in their eating habits
okay naturally it 's very important to drink water since it does a lot of advantages
i profoundly agree with them because sleeping is absolutely vital for every person because
i think it depends on people some people use it in a negative way which has negative effects on them however some people use it in a very positive way which has got positive impacts on their lifestyle
it is said that the environment is very important to take into account because of the fact that it has a lot of big problems such as the pollution nowadays
it is said that friends are a good and important part of your life
although there are some people that say that i am mother i think i am more similar to my father because we like to do the same things such as watch films or read books
i will choose to live in another country because it 's important to me get experiences and know all the creatures all the languages of other places so if i could i would live for example in london
it has both pros and cons on the one hand the advantage is that the students of schools and colleges should get or keep fit because of the fact that some scientific studies say that we must obtain some proteins or nutrients for our brain because our brains is working during the day and we need these substances to make a good connection between the brain and our body on the other hand disadvantages could be that the students have less time to study their unit so to sum up in my opinion it 's important to have time for all these types of activities
if you want to know how honey comes from flower and go to the shop i 'm going to explain it first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and bees make honey from nectar in beehives so this type of animal is said to be the most important animal in the planet because without them the planet could die secondly the beekeepers collected the honey from beehives in order to take into a recipient that is called jars by the end of the process they will have taken into a car where a person transports this type of recipient to a supermarket a shop and the people could buy this honey and take this food to their homes
if i were them i would choose a country where i could speak the language for example usa or london something like that because i could communicate with other people and it 's easier to me and other countries where the methodology is similar like the country where they came from
first of all the advantage of studying a second language is that you can communicate with other people for example you can travel to more countries because you know another language and you can understand what other people say to you
the difficulty of studying another country from a point of view is that you do n't have your family near so if you want them near or you need them you only could call them with your mobile phone or something like that
if you study in another country you must go outside and learn about the culture by different ways for example in order to know this type of culture you could visit monuments or church or festivities
because of the fact that you are outside for my point of view you become more independent because you have to do all by yourself you do n't have your family near your friends near so if you want something you have to obtain it alone so this is the reason why you become more independent
i 'm inclined to reading novels which can allow me stepping into the fantasy world that the books provide so when i have free time i like to read novels which also can provide me a sense of comfort and relaxed
i like to spend time with my husband because we share the same interests for example we like to watch movies whenever we watch movies which can also make us feel relaxed so i like to spend leisure time with my husband
i want to be the teacher because i think teacher is a meaningful job just a single word can transform the person 's life
if students want to use technology to study more effectively here come some ways the first of all they can use chat gbt to help them to revise their writing essays
i think if possible students should learn face to face from the teachers here come some reasons doing
i think if students can work by group project they can learn the communicating skills in order to achieve the same goal they should learn how to compromise and communicate with their group members besides
sure it 's a really nice place it has really nice living conditions and it has everything you need from supermarkets to recreational centers
as most of my whole days will be in summer i really like swimming because i think a really enjoyable way to spend my time you know swimming has already been enjoyable so i like doing it
i think i would say my mom because most of our opinions are in the same agreement which is why i really like talking to her here and i can ask any questions i need and she can have information about it
i would like to be a businessman as it 's been my ambition since my childhood to start a business
it 's argued by many people that all students who get occupations to pay for their university studies on their own it has several advantages the main of them is that they get the experience of working in a workplace and they have extra pocket money and they do not need to ask money for their parents but the jobs in their free time may not leave enough time for their university studies which is why i think it 's better for them to get jobs after finishing their degree
people who want to travel by airplane need to go through several stages first of all they obviously need to travel to airport and then they go to check in after their documents will be checked next and following this they go to security and once they pass they go to the waiting room in that room they can have meals or go to the toilet or something and they finally go on board to get ready for the flight
so i think technology has good impact on studying
i also think that face to face learning is the best way of studying because the students who are face to face studying will be under supervision because not every student is able to study without supervision
no i do n't think so because attending lectures have always seemed boring to students so i think reading alone can be a much more effective way of studying
i think it 's really important for universities to provide their students with modern learning facilities because if they are not up to date it can have a bad impact on their students ' productivity
well i 'm pretty interested in learning other countries because i like traveling so i think to learn other countries gives me better learning about other countries culture and i 'd like to travel and say other scenery and like to make friends from all over the world i think
well if it does n't rain outside i 'd like to take a walk near the riverbank or just have a walk dog
i guess it must be speaking because you know learning the foreign languages is the most important part is to speaking because while you 're speaking you may have some mistakes and the process of solving the mistakes will help you to improve yourself a lot
i suppose it might be to learn how to play the piano because i 've already know how to play the violin and i really love music and i think play piano is you know very graceful and i think that must be a wonderful thing
first i 'd like to explain the advantages as we all know that do part time jobs will give us more experience to work in the society and you know the university students that need to be a social social member and that will give them some money and give the more ways to get the money to pay for their life but there also some disadvantages because that might be a very distracting thing and maybe the students can be cheating the social while they are doing the part time jobs because there 's still students and they do n't have much rich social life experience in
for the pollutions turning to the acid rain and finally damage to the environment there are six steps in their returning first and while the wind had come and the acid particles are carried by the wind and then some of them fall as dust and they were dirty the lake or the soil and other acid particles mixed with cloud and water which will just turn into rain or snow but in the end also may turn the fall as dust and they will damage the trees the soil the land or the lake
first we need to eat it regularly and we need to avoid to eat more junk food like hamburgers or eat much sugar or oil
well i think that depends because we 're not the professional sporters so i think doing the exercise regularly and it 's very important because that will keep us better shape and make us healthy both basically and mentally i think
well i think that depends you know because you know the quality of our sleeping you know i think it 's important to have a great sleep environment instead of the time we sleep and i think eight hours sleep is also a great thing i think
i think generally we can think it 's bigger than it 's negative because i think nowadays we go to the hospital and we just take some ct or other science equipment to test our body 's health and that 's very convenient and
i love the summer because i have holidays and i like the sun and the sea and in the summer it 's more easy to look the sea and going to the sea
it 's very important for me because in my job i must know about the last news and i love the economy and i like tourists about the economy
i for a child i work for the natu and for the mountains and i love running too and i love running for the mountains and i can see wild animals
i love my athletes but in the future i would like to design new motorbikes for important motorbikes company for example ducati and i would like to buy bikes for me
it 's a good idea the students can learn a lot of new skills and they can look like the future jobs will be but on the other hand the students have a virtual free time and the students must rest and they must be focusing on the degree it 's a positive idea for me
tunis needs began very very bad because one day they had twenty thousand visits but they improved because in the seventh day they had one hundred thousand basses on the other hand music now they are very good but they did not improve because in the seven days they had eighty thousand visitors
and he must have good social skills and he must be a good target for communicating his decisions
