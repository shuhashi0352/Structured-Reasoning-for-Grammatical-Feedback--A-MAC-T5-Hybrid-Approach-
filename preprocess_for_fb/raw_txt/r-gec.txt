well to be honest i 'm not a big fan of the environment but however i still care about the environment and trees and animals
i suppose i am similar to my sister because she is near my age and we have some shared interests like we both enjoy playing games and computers
my whole life i 've been living in damascus syria but in the future i 'm planning to get canadian nationality and i 'm also planning to reside there for the rest of my life
having fitness classes is a very important thing students should keep their health and wellness at its best level because they are at the best age for health and they have to focus at that age on doing many sports and doing workouts actually on the other hand it has some disadvantages for example you know it might take up their time you know schools do n't have that much time my opinion is definitely do fitness classes in the school
hello everyone in today 's presentation we are going to talk about honey and how it 's produced so we are going to tell you how it goes from flowers to your hand and how it 's produced first bees collect the nectar from flowers then they return to the beehives and make the honey using the nectar when they are finished beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives then that honey is stored in jars when it is stored it is shipped to the shops and supermarkets this is the journey of the honey i hope you enjoyed it
there 's no doubt that choosing a country is an essential thing for students in order to decide in which university they want to study so first they should consider the safety of the country and the education quality
there is no doubt that the students who want to study abroad would face many difficulties
students have many options in order to learn about the country and the local culture in my opinion they can go and participate in social events
what we enjoy the most is playing video games
i am most similar to my father not only in a physical way but in an intellectual way we have similar ways of thinking
i would like to live in a city the cities i like the most are london paris and here in spain i would like to live in madrid or in barcelona i do n't care
and i think that schools and colleges should make time in the school day to practice some exercises and to promote a more healthy lifestyle because it can help to fight both physical and mental health problems and at the same time the disadvantage of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as study time or for learning some other things
honey is collected from beehives
i think that when a student is choosing a country to go to study there the first thing that they are thinking about is about the quality of the universities
i think that the best thing about studying in a second language is that you can put it in your resume and at the same time it is a very valuable thing that enterprises value
i think that there are a lot of constraints when you 're studying in another country first of all you have to learn a new language and speak a new language or your second language
i think that students can learn about local culture by going out with their classmates and learning from them and asking them
in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything on your own for example you have to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you do n't do when you live at home
it 's too cold in winter and too hot in summer
on holiday i like to enjoy my time because it 's a break i like to travel go to the beach and sometimes i stay at home watching movies
i like spending time with all my family with my brothers with my sister with my parents and also with my cousins
in the future i would like to work in a company called johnson and johnson and i would like the position of the senior engineer in the area of the development of new products
in my opinion it is a good idea that students get a job to pay for their studies but you have to have a part time job because you have to get a balance between your studies and your job one of the advantages is that you can get experience because a lot of students graduate but they have no idea about what the world of work is like in my opinion it is one of the best things that a student can do when they are still studying
the next picture shows the stages people need to good through when they go to travel by airplane first of all you have to get to the airport and do your check in after that you have to go to document control
technology offers us a lot of tools to improve the way we learn one of them is that we can look for all the information using the internet and we can look for example at videos
face to face is the best way to learn because you can see your teacher and you can concentrate better in this way you do not have distractions
group projects give us the opportunity to learn to work in teams to use all the abilities of each one of the members in a team
watching lectures online by yourself in my opinion it 's best because you can pause when you need instead when you are attending lectures with other people you can not do that
for example in my own experience i learn best when i am listening
it 's one hour to barcelona half an hour to the beach it 's a nice place
on holiday i enjoy staying with friends and going to the mountains sometimes to the beach
in my close family maybe with my mother in my larger family maybe with my brother in law
i am not sure but one possibility is as a teacher it 's one of my favorite jobs now
i think that one advantage is that while you are working you are learning what life is and at the same time you are studying of course and the disadvantage is that maybe you are too busy working and studying at the same time so you can get a little stressed and this is n't a good thing for your health and in my opinion i think that it 's a good idea to do both things at the same time working and studying because working you can learn a lot of things that you ca n't learn studying and studying you can learn things that you ca n't learn while working
to travel by airplane first you must arrive at the airport by car by train or by coach then when you are there you must check in after check in you must pass the document control where you need your passport after the security control you must wait for boarding then while you 're waiting you can have some lunch or a coffee then you are boarding after you board you can fly to your destination
i think that the technology can improve study because you can find information faster and at the same time you can stay in contact with other people
me too i think the same i think that face to face you are more interested in the person with you
with group projects the people can improve develop patience quiet listening and thinking more deeply and the communication is more efficient
in my case i think that it 's better reading alone because i prefer silence and quietness and calm
it 's important because not all the people have the possibility to have the all the facilities
that really matters to me to inform myself about what is happening in the world i think that 's really important to be aware of yeah what 's happening around me so i really enjoy listening to the radio in the morning
what i preferred when i was a child was playing with little cars and imagining a kind of city with homes buildings schools and i was a creative kid i think
i really hope to have the opportunity to live abroad coz i think it 's an incredible experience for instance i 'd like to go to america to the west coast to a city like san francisco and just enjoy it
and actually i do n't see lot of disadvantages there are not any drawbacks
but tunes net was the worst on the first day and after five days we can observe like an incredible increase in the visits to the website compared to the yellow site which was totally the opposite it just fell
they communicate a lot with their peers and i think that 's a good leader to be very communicative
i think the main issue is that you have so much work to do everything and i am deeply convinced that having a small team can create anxiety and problems
you just have to really communicate explain what you do
i 'm deeply convinced that you can do better work if you share your opinion and your ideas with coworkers but i 'm not sure that people working alone are bad at work
so it 's the best way
i enjoy hiking reading studying and spending time with my family and well i try to enjoy my free time a lot so i have a lot of hobbies and i work out
obviously the best way to improve my english is travelling abroad to countries where they speak english but it 's impossible to travel the whole year so studying
i 'm going to speak about if all students university students should do part time jobs while they are studying what is the main advantage the main advantage is obviously they can get money to pay for their studies a part time job gives them more independence and allows them to be in contact with real work however one of the disadvantages is they have less free time to study
these particles can fall on the earth as dust
the advice i would give is to eat mostly fruit and fresh vegetables and give up fast food and fatty food that can damage our health
i think it is better to sleep eight hours however sometimes it is impossible to do it because our busy lifestyle does n't allow us to sleep eight hours
technology can have a positive or negative effect
i am very interested in learning about other countries and personally i did study abroad in ireland and i met a lot of people from different countries especially from spain and poland and germany so i am very interested in learning from the cultures
i enjoy spending my free time with my family watching movies or series also by doing exercise with them hiking or walking around the house and yes
the best way to improve my english is by watching movies or series also by reading books and novels so that i can improve my skills in english
i think i would learn to read more and read faster because i am not that fast at reading so i would like to learn that to read more books and to learn more about the cultures of the world
good afternoon today we 're going to talk about if university students should do part time jobs while they are studying some of the advantages of having a part time job while studying are that the students take responsibility for their actions also they gain the skill of organising their time better and also the skill of working in teams and cooperating with each other a disadvantage is that they do not have much time to study so an effect is that their grades decline and they can fall asleep in class but in my own opinion i think it 's a good way for the students to learn teamwork and organisational skills in their life
good afternoon today we 're going to talk about how acid rain is created first the factors the initial factors are the factories and vehicles they create pollution in the air and this pollution creates acid particles in smoke this is carried by the wind and some of these particles fall as dust and some of these particles stay in the clouds and these particles are the ones that damage the environment so that is why we need to change the factors the vehicles and the factories to reduce acid rain
first of all they need to get rid of every candy they have in their house so that they can start eating good food to have a healthy life like fruit and vegetables and start planning a menu
i consider that drinking water is a good way of adopting a healthy lifestyle drinking two litres per day is a good amount of water to be hydratated and to be happy in your day
doing exercise is a good way of starting healthy living you can do exercise three or four times a week not in excess like every day
i consider that getting eight hours ' sleep in the night is a good way of adopting a healthy lifestyle
i consider technology has a bad impact on a healthy lifestyle because many people are now looking at their cellphones all the time instead of going outside and doing exercise
well i am interested really i 'm into it
well i do n't have much free time but i draw sometimes walk around the city go sightseeing or just visit museums and i adore watching films and series
well i think by diving into the context of english language i mean watching serials and films really helps me improve my language
well i would like to take up sports classes and i think like this discipline really would help me
it 's a suggestion that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying so there are some obvious advantages to this suggestion first of all they would get better at financial literacy they would know how to deal with the money they earn and they would become more independent from their parents which is a great advantage of this idea and i think it could be crucial for them
so i 'm gon na give a presentation about acid rain and how it affects the environment so it basically starts by vehicles and factories releasing emissions into the environment and it all comes out as smoke and acid particles that are in this smoke are being carried by the wind and are released into the clouds or just fall as dust on the ground these particles that are mixed with the cloud they settle on the ground and fall on forests as rain and snow and these forests are suffering from acid rain
i would recommend these people to listen to what their gut feelings tell them because they will know what food they really want and not what their brain but what their body wants to eat
it is essential to drink lots of water on a daily basis because our body consists of eighty percent water and it just really makes our metabolism work better
i agree with the opinion that sleeping around eight hours a day is a key habit because if you do n't sleep enough you will be tired and wo n't be productive at all
it 's quite a questionable opinion because technologies truly help people to make their lives easier but not always they can harm their health too i guess
it 's paella and it 's a wonderful rice dish another important point is the language spanish
on holidays i enjoy going with my family to the beach or with my friend to play football handball or another sport because it 's incredible and wonderful playing with your friends and i also play video games with my brother it 's wonderful
i personally think that i spend more time with my brother because my father is always working and this is terrible because if he is working all day i ca n't see him every day and this is a terrible problem
in the future if i have the possibility i want to do nursing to help people or to be a policeman because they can help people and it 's wonderful and impressive to help people and earn money
students should get jobs to pay for their university studies in my view because the advantages of this are that you are prepared for the future and you can get money but the disadvantage of this situation is that if you would prefer to play video games or do another thing you can not do it because you have to do this job but i personally think that it 's better to do a part time job not a full time job that takes all day because i think that university is for enjoying your life and then preparing for your future and working and getting money for your family because it 's essential
what you have to do when travelling by airplane first you have to travel to the airport then you have to check your documents at the document control with a policeman it is essential that all the documents are correct because if they are not correct you can not go by airplane and then you can wait in a restaurant or go to the toilet it 's essential to go to the toilet because in the airplane it 's more difficult than other places then you have to board the airplane and prepare for the plane because many people complain that they have had problems on airplanes
from my point of view students can study more efficiently with technology because they can use google on their computer and they can find more information than in a library and this is essential for a student
and this is a problem
and this is essential for the future because nowadays companies are working in groups and this is essential for your future
and this is better than reading alone which is boring
and this is a difficulty in other countries
i am very interested in knowing about other countries but i 'm in love with barcelona and i 'm in love with catalonia and spain too
i do shift work so i do n't have i think enough time to have free time but i enjoy meeting up with my friends and drinking some beers for example in the evenings
i think that the best way to improve my english is watching films in the original version for example in english and to meet some new people that are native speakers of english and yeah
i 'm going to talk about university students and if they should do part time jobs while they are studying i think that one of the advantages that they have if they are studying and they are working too is that they earn money to spend in their free time but maybe the disadvantage is that they do n't have enough time to study for example during a week when they have an exam but in my opinion it 's very important to work in the field of your studies to gain experience and practise
i am going to talk about how pollution causes acid rain the pollution of factories and vehicles goes up with the smoke forming acid particles then these acid particles that are carried by wind can do two things they can be mixed with cloud water or fall as dust if they mix with cloud water then when the clouds collide they fall with the rain or the snow causing damage to the environment and causing damage to the people that are on the ground
i think that it 's very important to have good eating habits for example you have to have a schedule for what you eat in the evening or in the morning i think that is very important
it is known that our body is practically eighty percent water so it 's very important to drink a lot of water in our daily life and throughout the whole day
i think that it 's not necessary to do exercise every day of the week but it is important to do exercise to have good health so at least two or three days a week is important
i think that it 's important to sleep at least six or seven hours but i think that it 's not necessary to sleep eight hours
i think that for some people it can affect them negatively
oh it 's a beautiful island very green well to be honest just in the north it 's very green and we have like two sides the south is drier but very beautiful as well with a lot of beaches
when i am on holidays i really enjoy being quiet relaxing maybe going to the beach and staying there alone you know listening to the sea the waves i 'm trying to be relaxed
well lately i really enjoy spending time with my niece she 's very cute she 's always looking for new games and well she 's very nice i love her and i love to spend time with her
i really would like to be a potter it 's what i really want to do
it 's very common that students at university have a job to pay their fees their expenses during the course but let 's see the pros and cons first it 's true that when you have a job you have more resources you can pay for more things in my humble opinion i think if you can afford it it 's better that you focus on your studies
the diagram shows the stages people need to go through to travel by airplane in the diagram let 's start you need to arrive at the airport by train or bus or with your own car then you need to check in next you should pass document control and security well once you are free you just have to wait sit down in a cafe or go to the toilet and wait for the departure then when you are on board just relax and enjoy your flight
nowadays it is obvious that technology may be one of the main resourses for students they can use it for mainly the internet to research anything they need
but i think in my opinion studying on your own is really good
they can develop skills social skills communication skills teamworking how to share ideas with other people
yeah absolutely
i am really interested because i 'm studying architecture and i always pay attention to how i can be respectful of the environment with my buildings so it 's really important
we enjoy going out to restaurants drinking some good beer and eating some good tasty food
i 'm really similar to my father it 's not easy to say that but we are really similar we also do the same things in different ways but in the end we are really similar
i would like to live near to the desert i do n't know why but the more i study architecture the more i like the buildings and houses built in the desert i really love the desert
i think it 's really important for everyone to do some exercise during the week but the bad thing is that in our everyday life we do n't have a lot of time for exercise we 're really busy so having some time in our schools or colleges to do some fitness classes is really good for everyone and it will help to keep our health in a good state so it 's really good for everyone the bad thing is that you have to go to college with extra clothes to change into when you finish your fitness classes
i 'm really glad that this question is about honey because i am all for honey and i know really well how honey is made first of all you have a bee the bee goes into the countryside and the bee sees a flower he goes to the flower and takes some nectar from the flower he takes the nectar to his house there the bee makes some honey from the nectar then the beekeepers go to the beehives and take all the honey then they put the honey into jars the jars go straight to the shop and then you go to your local shop
in the first place they have to choose the language they want to learn if they want to learn italian they have to choose a country where the local people speak that language
if you study in another language that is not yours it becomes easier for you to learn that language faster so it 's a really good thing for you to learn a new language
first of all if you have never studied in a place other than where you were born it will be really difficult if you do n't speak the language of that place so that is one of the things
it 's easy you have to make new friends from the place where you are studying then you meet local people they 'll teach you and show you what you are supposed to do
yeah that is true because you live alone your family is not living in that place so you have to learn to do everything by yourself you have to cook you have to clean your house
it is close to disneyland it takes twenty minutes to go by bicycle
usually i go shopping with my friends going shopping and talking with my friends reduces my stress so going shopping is a good way to spend time on holiday
i often spend time with my mother we often watch movies and t v programmes and laugh together
i would like to be a pilot because being a pilot has been my dream since i was four years old that is a challenging job i know but i would like to be a pilot
i think all students should not get jobs but they do part time jobs because there are advantages and disadvantages an advantage is they can know how hard it is to earn money to live and a disadvantage is their job is not to work just to study so like it is really hard to make the time to study if they do a job so i think they do part time jobs
there are six steps to take to travel by airplane i 'm going to explain each step number one we should go to the airport and number two after arriving at the airport we should go to a counter to check in number three officers check our passport number four officers also check our luggage to ensure we do not have like dangerous items and then number five just wait to board and number six board the airplane
students should use apps like study apps while taking a train or bus on trains or buses we have some free time so can use apps to study effectively
the face to face studying style is best i think because like teachers can know like how well students understand the class
i think like the listening skill is going to be developed in group projects
i think attending lectures is a better way to study i mean because if we can not understand the class we can ask the teacher to teach us
it 's a really big town
well i really like spending time with my mum because together we can do everything but the thing i really love the most is going shopping with her because we can spend hours and hours just browsing in the shops and it 's really fun
the job i would like to have is to be a teacher a biology teacher and for this reason nowadays i 'm doing a master 's like a master 's to be a teacher in the future
in my opinion for the students i think it 's a really good idea to get a job just to pay for their university studies because i think that getting a job could be a really good way to be more responsible and to know how important it is to get a job and how difficult it is to earn some money on the other hand it 's true that if the students have a job they have less time to go to class or to study
if you want to travel by airplane the first thing you have to do is go to the airport you can travel by car and also you can get the train or maybe a bus then when you arrive at the airport the first thing you have to do is go to do the check in then you have to leave your luggage and you can take your ticket your flight ticket then you have to go to document control and then you have to pass security control they are going to check your luggage and all your documents and also your ticket to get on the airplane then if you have some free time you can wait at a cafe so maybe you can go shopping in the duty free one
the good thing about using technology to study is that you can check all the things that you maybe wrote in class and find more and more information about a topic and then you can know more and have more knowledge
i think so i think if you are learning face to face with your teacher you can ask him all the questions you may have
i think it 's a really important thing to work in groups on projects because it 's really important to know how you work with others you have to spend time with other people in your future job
i think it 's more effective because if you just read alone you do n't speak with others and you ca n't hear others ' opinions and i think this is better for our knowledge and also for our studying
i think we are not all the same and it 's really important to give learning facilities because maybe some people need them and it 's really good for them
i have a deep interest in learning about other countries it 's something that catches my attention and i think that i can learn a lot about it
being a sporty person i can say that i love to go running and jogging with my friends and with my children also
to improve my english i think that the best option is to listen and to speak with other people even though it 's hard for me to do it
from since i was a child i have wanted to learn to sew i would like to make my own clothes
i see the advantages and on the other hand the disadvantages for the first ones i can say that by working while you are studying you can learn other skills that are impossible to pick up in class in addition to this you can make contact with friends and with other people so you can enrich your university experience on the other hand if you are working at the same time that you are studying you have less time to dedicate to your exams as well as that usually the work schedules are bad and you will be tired
acid particles come from factories and vehicles since they are very small they 're extremely difficult to see they travel mixed in with the fumes so that they end up in our woods as well as in the water
to start with i would say them that soda is something dangerous that they should avoid in order to improve their health and eating habits
bearing in mind that our body is almost all water it 's necessary and unavoidable for us to drink water
absolutely however you should remember that doing exercise is not only going to the gym but also you can do exercise while you are doing the shopping or cleaning the house for example
how many hours you need to sleep are different for each person
at this point i have a mixture of feelings and thoughts but i would like to say that although technology is something positive in general people tend to use it badly
as i have said i live in mallorca which is an island i like living there but it could be difficult for those people who are not into it because if you want to go somewhere you need to take a plane and it 's not that easy
i also like being cold but i prefer doing things which involve the sun
well that 's a difficult question because i love spending time with my family all of them but if i have to choose someone i would choose my brother because we only differ by four years and we have a lot of things to talk about and some things in common that we can compare
when i was little i always wanted to be an astronaut and that 's because i studied physics and nowadays i do n't want to be an astronaut but i do like things that involve space
i do n't agree with the statement in this question because even though it has some advantages like for example you learn how to earn your own money and you become more i do n't know autonomous it also has some disadvantages such as not having free time because you are spending your time either studying or working but not spending the money that you are earning for example so my opinion is clear in that case i think you should n't but also i think that university studies should be free for everyone so everyone has the same opportunities
traveling by airplane is one of the most normal things to do nowadays first of all you need to go to the airport so you can go there maybe using some public transport because otherwise you need to pay for your car to stay there once there you need to do your check in where your luggage will be reviewed then you need to wait for your flight and board the plane which is usually done by groups finally you take off in your plane and enjoy your trip
they can use technology in a lot of ways
well i agree with this statement but in fact with the covid nineteen situation i would say that learning online as i have been for my english classes it 's a good way too
there are a lot of skills that can be learnt working in groups but i think the most important thing is to learn how to collaborate and listen to the other people because it is important if you want to work with other people just learn to listen
yes i agree with that because if you are reading alone maybe there is something that you do n't really understand but you just skip it while if you are attending a lecture maybe these people who know how to do that can teach you
i think nowadays it is essential because with new technologies it is really easy for them to create facilities which can help us study more effectively so i think it 's essential and they should do that
when i was a child i enjoyed going to the park to play with my friends obviously my mother came with me and also i remember that at weekends my family and me went to the mountain
so i would like to work in a law office or maybe in a big company my father is a lawyer so it 's easier for me to work in a law office than in a company
that 's an interesting topic and i 'm going to start my fourth year so i 'm doing my period of practical work experience the principal disadvantage for me at least is that i do n't have enough time
ok this graph shows how many people visited the sites during their first week online we can see that there are three music sites tunes net music now and songs for you they are represented by three colours blue red and yellow and we can see that the majority of people visited music now so it 's the most popular site during the four first days a minority of people visited tunes net
in my opinion a team leader will be able to listen to the other members of the group
the main problem probably will be that there are not enough proposals or ideas for doing the job but for me it 's not a problem
in my opinion it 's important that members of the group have different opinions because in this way they can discuss and debate and probably there will be a better solution
i believe that it 's better that the group are face to face in order to discuss the different solutions but it 's not the most important thing to do a good job
i strongly believe this statement because when you work alone maybe you do n't think of all the possibilities
i live in a big house it has five rooms one for each member of my family and i have my room with two beds and one bathroom and one closet
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy going to the beach enjoy being with my family doing things i do n't usually do while i am studying or doing busy things so i enjoy being happy and relaxed and also reading books
i most enjoy spending time with my mother coz she is teaching me how to cook when we talk we are like friends and also she teaches me a lot of things that i would n't learn if i talked with someone else
in the future i would like to work in a company that gives me an opportunity to develop my career studies like financial management trading or something like that
college students should get a job to pay for their university studies most of them fail when doing both things so an advantage is that you could get more money and pay your university but the disadvantage is that you do n't get the knowledge that you should get if you dedicate all your time to study sometimes it 's hard to work and study at the same time
what you need to do if you are going to travel by airplane first you have to travel to the airport then you have to go to the officer and go through document control and you have to wait in the cafe or you can go to the bathroom or just wait for your plane then you have to board the airplane and just fly that 's it have a nice flight
students can use technology to study more effectively since they can search for everything they want on the web that 's because the internet and cell phones and computers enable us to be more flexible
i think that learning face to face with a teacher it 's better but we are in the pandemic situation and it 's not easy to learn with classes online so i do n't like them i prefer face to face really i understand more than in online classes
if you work with a group on a project you can learn how to work in a group you learn how to share your information with other people
well i prefer to read alone coz i understand more if i do n't understand i read it and read it again and again and again until i understand but attending lectures if you understand that 's good if you do n't sorry
it 's very important for the universities to provide learning facilities coz if the university has a good level of learning facilities the students will use all these facilities so the students are going to be in the highest level of students
i 'm really interested in the environment because i think it is very important if the environment is well our life is well too however if we do n't take care of it we have a lot of problems with our lives for example
i am very similar to my father we are both very kind and besides we are very similar we look the same
i would live in the same town because i think that my town is fantastic and i do n't want to move for this reason
doing exercise is very important to be fit and for this reason both schools and colleges should make a timetable where there is a time to do fitness classes this is very important so the student can have a rest and practice exercise however some students can think that it is n't important and maybe they would prefer to meet friends or spend their time studying or doing anything else
in the first place bees collect nectar from flowers then they make honey from nectar in beehives when the beehives are full beekeepers collect the honey and they put it in jars when they have enough jars they transport them to the supermarket by car or by lorry it depends and finally the jars of honey are sold in the supermarket
the student should choose another country because they want to learn another language and this way is the best for them
the advantage of studying in a second language is that you can learn another language
when you are far from your country and you leave your family and friends sometimes you can feel lonely and this is very important for me
it depends it is n't necessary to go abroad to become independent for example you can live with your father or your family in general but you can be independent and do your housework and cook your food
my favourite time of the year is winter but also spring that is because here in spain summers are very hot and i do n't enjoy them very much
i think it is very important to be aware of the news because if you want to change something that you do n't like you first have to know that it is happening if you do n't know if it is happening you ca n't change it
as a child i used to spend my free time cycling because i really like bikes and also going out with friends playing table games with them on the street
in the future i would like to work as a receptionist because i 'm studying tourism and also i would like to go to live in london because i want to improve my english more and more
although there are a lot of people that think it is not necessary to include a period of practical work experience in degree courses there is a lot of argument about this on the one hand including a period of practical work experience is positive because you are going to be more prepared to go into the labour market when you are out of the university also you are going to learn about things that are only learned when you are working in a different place from the university for example having a boss and some things like that on the other hand it is difficult to include a period of practical work in a degree course that has a large theoretical component because you are going to take time off from that
i think the main problem of working in a small team is that if they are not very interested in the problem in the thing they are working on it is not going to be finished
i think that it is necessary to be face to face in order to be effective because this year for example in my degree i have been working in a team online and it was really difficult to organise all the work and it is better to be face to face
if the members of the team are very good and they are hard workers it can be better than being alone but if not maybe it is better to work by yourself
i would say quite a lot because i 'm a person who is very keen on travelling around the world and one of the aspects that i most like is to know more about the other culture
i try to take it easy honestly after i have been working so i 'm mad about making plans to spend time at the beach or in the natural environment where i can find my own peace and quiet
there are many ways to improve my english also to listen to music with the lyrics written down
i think it could be to learn another language like for example french because it could bring me many opportunities to develop my professional career i 'm also interested in international business
to get a job while you 're studying could have many pros and cons as everything else in life a primary advantage could be that you can have some savings which will be great for paying your tuition fees which are really expensive or even to hang out at the weekend with your friends
well let 's explain the process of acid rain which is represented in the presentation or in the graphs that we have below so it starts in the factories and vehicles which are the main sources of pollution the acid particles produced in the factories are in the smoke that is carried by the wind some acid particles normally fall as dust and others are mixed with cloud water so the final result is snow or rain that contains those acid particles causing damage to the environment so that 's one of the main problems that we are having nowadays with climate change and global warming
i would recommend them to follow a balanced diet with lots of fresh vegetables and fruit and forget about any miracle diet that promises you will lose weight very easily and fast because they do not bring you anything good
scientists around the world claim that to drink at least two liters of water per day is fundamental to keeping you healthy so i totally agree with them i consider drinking water really good for health so yeah i will follow their advice
most definitely at least to do some walking or to go running you do n't need to do vigorous exercise but i think it 's important to move a bit throughout the day
well i do n't know if you need to rest eight hours or less but what i 'm pretty sure about is that you need to rest the necessary time because you need to have energy to face the next day
it totally depends on the way you use that technology it has brought us many benefits obviously like the instant connection with your family and friends
i 'm so interested in the environment because we are living in a changeable world and it is pretty important to be part of the change and think about the environment for the future generations and to take care of them and our environment
we like to go to the cinema we like to travel to different cities or different countries we like to go to restaurants and we like to have parties at night
i am so similar to my mother people say that i am her twin because we 're pretty similar i am twenty three years old i have black hair black eyes and i am very thin as she is
i would like to live in italy last year i had the opportunity to travel over there and i fell in love with their customs their traditions the language and the people the people are so friendly over there and the places are so pretty
i think one advantage i can find if colleges make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes is that they will have a better lifestyle and a healthy lifestyle with different kinds of traditions too that improve their lives the one disadvantage i can find is that not all students like to do sports some prefer to do art activities or another kind of activity
good afternoon i am going to talk about the process of how honey is produced to start we can see in the first circle a bee and flowers it represents bees collecting nectar from flowers after they collect that nectar the bees make honey from nectar in beehives and after that beekeepers collect the honey from the hives beekeepers are the people who are in charge of collecting the honey from the beehives and also they are in charge of putting the honey into different kinds of jars it could be in a glass bottle or in a plastic bottle and after that it can be transported to the supermarket where you are able to acquire it
i think they have to consider the documentation they need like a passport or visa or other documents the language they speak their customs their traditions their religion and of course the region where it is
i think the first advantage you have if you are able to study in a second language is that you will have the opportunity to get a better job and of course make yourself understood in that language the second language spoken the most is english
it 's not the same pounds or euros or dollars it 's different
well i think you have to be friendly with people who live there so you can make friends and they can teach you about their culture and you have a good relationship
that is what 's very nice about it
on holiday i enjoy travelling to different places i like to visit other countries or other cities and get to know them get to know their history
he 's twenty years younger than me and he 's one of my favourite people in the world
in the future i would love to be a university professor i would like to teach in the area of education possibly regarding inclusion or didactics that would be my favorite job my ideal job
one advantage of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies would be that once they graduate they would already have some experience and perhaps even some idea of what field they want to go into however there are some huge disadvantages for instance students might not have enough time to focus on their university studies if they have to be working instead drop out rates might increase a lot because what would be the point of studying if you already have a job that is paying quite well certainly well enough to finance a college education in my opinion students should not get jobs to pay for university studies students should get scholarships or some other alternative funding
the very first thing you need to do is travel to the airport you can do this by different means of transport such as car or bus or even the subway depending on the options available once you 've arrived at the airport the first thing you need to do is go to the check in at the check in they will give you some information about your flight they will put your luggage into the hold and they will give you your boarding pass you will need your boarding pass as well as your i d to go through document control and security once you pass security you just need to wait until the stewardesses give you the chance to board
for instance you can take notes faster you can record and later listen calmly or you can even use the internet to find more information about any topic you want to learn more about
i think learning with a teacher face to face can be useful for lower levels of learning or young learners people who might have some trouble identifying gaps in their knowledge or managing their own learning
for me personally it is i can focus for much longer if i 'm listening to a person rather than reading by myself and i also appreciate having the opportunity to ask questions or make comments and then we can all pitch in and have a greater depth of knowledge
sometimes they have classes very early in the morning and very late in the afternoon or they live far away and they need the learning facilities
i 'm really interested in learning about other countries for example i really love england i have been there several times and i always try to learn something new when i go there for example i have read different books i have taken different classes on its culture and i think it 's really interesting
well i do different things for example lately i have taken up cooking i have been developing my cooking skills and i have learnt about different recipes but for example i also love listening to music doing sport and of course hanging out with friends so that 's more or less my free time
well for me the best way of improving your english is being part of a community of people learning english and furthermore also of a community of english speaking people so that way you can be in contact with them and you will learn a lot by communicating with other people
well i would really love to learn how to code because i have always loved technology and computers and i have been so amazed by those programmers who can code a new app or video game just by reading sentences
well i think that taking a job while you 're studying is a really good experience for example some of the advantages will be that you will be able to learn new things which will be useful for your learning experience for example you will learn how to manage yourself how to develop other skills such as time management and how to organise yourself and how to be responsible for your own actions however there will also be disadvantages for example you would have less time to focus on your studies and so i think it 's really important to be able to know what you can do with your time for example if you know that you are going to need a lot of time for studying you should n't take a job because it will take you a lot of time and it will not be possible for you to focus on your job or your learning at the university so even if it 's a really good experience i think that you should be really sure about what you will do
acid rain is generated by vehicles and by factories so when they create pollution that pollution gets up into the atmosphere there the acid particles are carried by the wind and end up mixed with particles of water which will create a cloud that cloud will end up raining over the earth and it will have a lot of effects so for example it will cause deforestation it will cause animals to die and it will cause a lot of environmental problems for example it could mean that the terrain is not good for growing things so we will have not only damage to the environment but also to ourselves because we have to remember that we are living in that environment so the effects that we have on it will end up affecting us also so yeah
well the best advice on that i can give them is to keep track of what you 're eating so for example they can take a piece of paper and write down every day everything they eat so like that at the end of the week they can compare days and they will be able to see ok in which moments they ate unhealthily
well for me it 's really important to drink water we have to remember that we are mainly made up of water so we really should focus on that if we do n't take in enough water we could have some effects as severe as depression or anxiety so by drinking a lot of water we are helping ourselves to be better
well i think that even if it 's just for a bit we should do exercise every day we can also do another type of exercise for example like climbing or walking to work
well i think it really depends on the person so for example some people may need eight hours or more to be able to have enough energy for the whole day while some others would have enough with five or six hours so i think it 's important that we know what we really need and we should try to focus on that
this is really good because we can keep track of our progress
so i think it is a good time to spend my free time with them
i think it is essential to listen to and read the news because you need to know about all that is happening in the world and the economy and politics so i think it could be a good idea to know the news
i used to go to my cousin 's house but then i loved playing basketball and going with my brother to play video games and play with other friends
okay one of the advantages of including practical work experience in the university degrees is you could put all your knowledge into doing different types of activities that you will do in your future work however i believe one of the disadvantages is people will not focus on the different subjects that they have i think it 's a very big problem in my opinion having a period of practical work experience is very important for students to improve themselves and their knowledge and to put all they have into doing a good job and to have a very short experience of their future careers
ok in the graph we can see three lines one red one yellow and one blue first the red line represents tune net we can see in the first five days the line shows an increase in the thousands of people who listen to tunes net and on the seventh day a total of one hundred thousand people listen to tunes net however we can see music now is more constant and has a high level all the week
i think a very good team leader is a person who has got different skills
working in small groups is very difficult because you could agree or not agree with the people in your team and you have n't got a lot of different ideas about doing the work so i believe that it 's better to work in big teams
i think a contrast in opinions is very important for doing a job well
i do n't think so i believe that working in a team you do n't mind if you are working face to face or online but it is essential to have different conversations to do a job well
so i believe that working in a team is better than working alone
well now i 'm living in the united states it 's beautiful and it 's a good experience because i can improve my english here
i like spending time with my friends and travelling
spending time with my parents and my sister
i 'd like to be an archaeologist
in my opinion it 's good for you to have a part time job so you can study and work i think that 's the best solution
first if you 're going travelling by airplane you need to travel to the airport you can go by car by bus or by subway or train when you get to the airport you need to do the check in and then you need to pass through document control and the security you need to wait so while you are waiting you can go to eat something or you can use the restroom or buy some souvenirs or have a coffee then you can go on board the airplane and then your flight is ready to go
technology can help you a lot with studying and learning
but technology helps a lot but i think face to face is the best
you need to think about someone else what teamwork is so i think this is a great skill and you need to learn about being responsible
i think both are great attending lectures can help you a lot with a lot of subjects but i also like to read alone
universities need to find ways to make it easier for students to learn or for students to want to learn for them to want to do that
the environment is n't a topic that i am very interested in
there are plenty of things that me and my friends enjoy doing together for example we like to go for a walk and have some drinks we also love to watch movies and have a great time together
i believe that the person that i am more similar to in my family is my mother in fact we are a little bad tempered but we also can be very kind and lovely with people that we care about
at the moment i do n't really know where i want to live in the future i do know that i wanna be able to travel and discover different countries to make up my mind about where i want to live when i 'm an adult
schhols and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes in fact there are many advantages to this for example students will be healthier and will have a hobby outside of school there are some disadvantages for example they can be more tired and maybe if the facilities are n't modern they wo n't have showers to take a shower after they exercise
i am going to give a presentation for you about how honey is produced first of all bees collect nectar from different flowers after that bees make honey from nectar in beehives beekeepers collect the honey that 's produced by the bees and fill some pots with that honey after that truck drivers collect those pots to take them to the stores where the pots are stored and are available for customers to buy this process is a very interesting process and shows us how nature works
there are many elements that students should consider before choosing a country for example they should see what is the rating of the university they 're choosing they also have to list their priorities
studying in a second language gives you many advantages in fact it allows you to meet new people
there are many difficulties of studying in another country in fact you have to adapt to another culture
when students are studying in another country they can learn about local culture by meeting people by going to museums or art galleries
for sure studying in a new country helps you become independent in fact you need to be organised
i am very interested in learning about other countries because i love to look at the difference between cultures i appreciate the historic places the food everything
i love to spend my free time with friends especially during the weekend or in holidays because we have fun together and also with my family
i think the best way is travelling and talking with people from other countries or cities yeah also watching films in the original version and t v shows reading is a good method too
i would love to learn how to do gardening i love gardening but i am terrible with plants my plants are always like sick and i would love to learn gardening
the main advantage of doing a part time job while you are studying is that it 's the best way to know how your future will be about the reality of your future world of the profession that you have chosen the other point here is that you can realise that you have chosen something that you do n't like so in my opinion it is a really great opportunity to be sure about your choice and about your future because your work life will be long so you need to be sure about it
hello i 'm going to talk about acid rain and what things acid rain causes factories and vehicles create pollution pollution forms acid particles that are in smoke smoke carries these acid particles on the wind some of these acid particles maybe fall as dust in water and contaminate our water like lakes and the sea
in my opinion good eating habits are so important to our health to our body to our mind so i recommend healthy eating habits to feel better
the human body is made up of a high percentage of water so drinking water is important to us because we need to be hydratated and we need water for our body
in my opinion it is important to do exercise at least three days per week if you can do exercise every day just a little it is healthier than not doing it
i think sleeping well is really important to us because we need to rest so if you can sleep at least eight hours it will be great for your body
it 's a good question it 's so important for me to learn about other countries because it 's necessary to learn new languages or about new cultures about other countries and other cities
in my free time i enjoy preparing some desserts or making some cakes or biscuits
it 's a good question let me think there are a lot of skills but i would like to learn to be a professional cook or something like this
hi everyone i 'm talking about this topic all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying so the first question is what are the advantages in my own opinion there are some advantages because university students can earn some money with these jobs but on the other hand there are some disadvantages because these university students do n't learn everything about their degree
hello everyone this is my presentation this is a diagram about acid rain in this diagram you can see six stages for this the first stage is pollution and this is produced by factories and vehicles then in the second stage the acid particles are in smoke and then these acid particles are carried by wind in stage four and five some acid particles fall as dust and the other acid particles mix with cloud water at the end in the sixth stage acid particles are in rain or snow
in my own opinion i firmly believe drinking water it 's so important because it 's good for your body and for a healthy lifestyle
in my own opinion it 's not necessary to do exercise every day of the week
it depends on the people because technology in my own opinion it 's so important because you can look for everything on the internet and on social media
there 's no such thing as free time i tend to prefer outdoor activities to indoor activities but i recognize that sitting quietly and reading a book is a great way to spend my free time
certainly i believe that the best way to improve my english is speaking with my form mates and writing some articles
i would just love to learn surfing
the main advantage of doing part time jobs during university could be the practical experience gained it is a noticeable fact that at university theoretical aspects are studied in depth but the practical ones are hardly ever covered however a negative aspect of those jobs is the time you invest in them it is time you take away from your social life or from your study time
the smoke or acid particles are carried by winds but the other ones are mixed with cloud water
well to have a healthy lifestyle it 's very important to drink a lot of water because your body needs this water
yes sure i certainly agree with this i would say it 's extremely important in a healthy lifestyle because it keeps you fit
i 'm interested in culture in the language in the monuments that are there in the temperature the weather
to improve my english i am studying by reading and listening to the news in english on t v
i need for example to learn new skills in the english language
i can see one advantage and one disadvantage in my opinion there are more advantages than disadvantages the advantage is if you have a part time job you can help to pay the school fees however if you have a part time job there is less of your time that you can study in and finishing your studies there should be your first objective
there is a lot of pollution in the world the pollution is from vehicles and factories amd the atmosphere absorbs this pollution and some particles absorbed are very very acidic some acid particulates fall as dust and the other acid particles mix with the clouds
yes it 's important to sleep eight hours a day but there are some people with five six hours it 's ok and other people need nine ten hours
generally it 's positive in the hard jobs
i am interested in studying in european countries i like their culture and ways of life
in my free time i like to read books and play computer games
the best way for me to improve my english is to talk to native speakers and watch english movies in the original version
perhaps i would study european history
the advantages of working while studying are that you can earn extra money and gain experience the disadvantages are the high workload for the students i think working while studying is good because it makes you more responsible
factories and vehicles pollute the environment acid particles get into the air and are carried by the wind in different directions some particles fall as dust others are mixed with water acid in the clouds mixes with rain and snow and falls to the ground this is how forests rivers and fields are polluted and animals die out
i try to eat what i want but at the same time avoid fast food such as hamburgers and cola
i try to drink more clean water to do this i have a water filter at home
i exercise every day to strengthen my leg muscles
i try to sleep eight hours a day but sometimes i ca n't sleep more than six hours
i feel good about other people 's technology because everyone has their own plan for sleeping exercising and eating
i 'm very much interested in the environment because our healthy living depends on a clean environment so i care a lot about the environment i try not to waste or pollute air water or the land
besides that i also like to watch a movie with my friends at home or in a movie theater
i 'm not sure but my relatives say that i am most similar to my father
i 'd like to settle in the countryside in the future i have been wanting to build a farmhouse in the countryside i want to spend the rest of my life close to nature
schools and colleges should have a daily routine of physical activities for all the students there are numerous benefits of doing regular exercise a student can stay fit both physically and mentally by doing regular exercise it will help him or her to concentrate more on his or her studies ultimately it will help him or her to achieve a better outcome and i do n't see any disadvantages of doing regular exercise unless you are overdoing it in my opinion it should be made mandatory for every student to do regular exercise at a particular time
today we will see how honey is produced from the diagram we can see that at the very beginning the nectar produced by flowers is collected by bees in the next stage the nectar is deposited into beehives and the bees turn nectar into honey later the collected honey is poured into jars or containers and then the packaged honey is transported to shops or stores for final delivery to consumers
there are many factors a student should consider when he or she decides to study abroad first of all he or she needs to know that the educational standard in that country is very high
the obvious advantage is that a student learns a different language and he understands how to communicate better in that language and besides he or she can learn about a different culture
the major drawback will be coping with the culture of the country and secondly they might not get help as soon as possible because they will have no relatives in the country
while studying abroad students can learn about the local culture by watching movies at a movie theater or by going to a concert with friends they can also learn about the local culture by visiting museums
i also agree that studying abroad helps a student to become independent because when a student studies abroad he or she needs to do many things on his or her own
my favourite activities for spending my free time are going to the gym going to the gym to train meeting with my friends or watching t v watching football on the t v
i think that the best way to improve my english is going to a place where english is the main language like england australia u s a
i would like to be invisible so people ca n't see me when i want to play a trick for example
in my opinion the advantages of doing part time jobs for university students are that these students have more money than the students who do n't work and the students have more work experience but the disadvantages are that the students have less time to study to do university work
in the diagram you can see the process to generate acid rain in the first picture the pollution is generated by the factories and vehicles in the second picture the acid particles are in smoke later acid particles are carried by wind and it has two steps some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water
drinking water is an important habit because you need to keep hydrated
yeah doing exercise is very important for maintaining good physical condition and it 's essential to maintain a healthy body
sleeping for eight hours is very important to have a great rest
technology is very useful to help people to improve their body
well i 've never thought about the environment itself but when i like travel to the countryside i do like to appreciate the nature the trees and animals
there are many things that we enjoy doing together just like playing video games or practising some sports but i think that our favourite activity is going to a restaurant for dinner
but when talking about personality i think my personality is more similar to my mother 's
if i have the money and the opportunity i would like to live in taiwan that is my home country and it 's a very safe place a safe country to live in
and there are many advantages of having fitness classes during the school day since usually the students do n't have time to practice any sports outside school since they are busy with their studies the only disadvantage that i see is if you make the classes obligatory
first and foremost the students should look at the university 's reputation
there are many difficulties and challenges that a student may face when studying abroad just like speaking a language that is not your mother tongue and adapting to a new lifestyle
i think that the best way to know about the local culture of a different country is to visit the touristic places and speak to the local people
i totally agree with that thinking because when you study abroad you do n't have your parents to support you and to help you
i live in a small city surrounded by a lot of green beaches
i prefer to go shopping in the evening and also visiting beaches in the morning especially swimming it 's so wonderful and amazing it 's a wonderful activity which i prefer to do in the morning
i prefer to be with my family especially my wife i love her so much we sit and have a discussion about our problems about our future and what we would do to fix our problems and how to solve them in a good way
i do n't want to make any change to my job i just want to get my master 's degree in mathematics
nowadays the fees for university study are increasing dramatically this is wonderful if you are doing this the bad thing the drawback the detrimental thing is that you need to focus on your study and instead of doing this you maybe focus on work all of the time in my opinion students should find a balance between their work and their study in university
travelling by airplane is an important and convenient way to travel from one country to another but first of all you should travel to the airport and try to come on time because if you do n't come on time you will miss your plane and after that you will go to check in and after checking in document control they examine everything and they scan your documents after that you will go through security and they do their work in a good way after doing all of this you wait for your plane and before your plane takes off there will be the boarding and then enjoy your flight to another country
technology is very important in students ' lives
when the students work in a group they learn from each other that is important and they learn more about how they can communicate in a group not in an individual way
i think it 's more important for a student to attend lectures because they will learn everything about the lesson which they are studying
it 's very important for the university to offer a student modern facilities like a laboratory on the internet and to search for information on the internet using his tablet
my favourite time of year is summer because in summer i can go to the beach or i can go shopping with my friends or with my family
i think it 's very important to listen to or read the news today thanks to the internet it 's easy to read or listen to the news
when i was a child i remember i used to play with my brother at home or with my friends in the park i liked football
in the future i would like to be a teacher for this reason i am learning english i am studying english in a private academy because i need to pass an exam
this picture shows visits to three new online pop music sites in the picture we can see in red tunes net in blue music now and in yellow song four you and the best or most listened to is music now followed by songs four you and last is tunes net
in a small team it 's more difficult to learn
definitely i think it 's better to work with a team because working with people is easier
i enjoy drinking with my friend because i like drinking alcohol and then my friend likes it too much and so we can communicate with each other more smoothly
my mother is the most similar to me firstly my character is similar to my mother 's and then my behaviour is similar to my mother 's too
therefore i want to live in the centre of tokyo
it is saying schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes therefore i think schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes
ok i will give a presentation about how honey is produced and secondly some bees make honey from nectar in beehives and then some bees concentrate the honey thirdly beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives and then the beekeepers can put the honey in bottles and then they transport them to the store
some students should consider choosing a country more carefully because some countries are dangerous for students
the students can have difficulty studying in another country because it is possible that it might be different from their native country
yes i agree with this opinion because students can not rely on somebody who can speak their mother tongue
my city is a small one it 's built around a castle it has quite some history but i do n't think it 's really fun to live here there 's not much to do
i like to read i like to go to the beach i like to climb mountains and hike this year i 'm going camping and i think it 's going to be a pretty cool experience
so my dog it 's my dog but out of the people i think it 's my brother no my mother my mother definitely out of the people of everyone it 's my dog his name is fred he 's a cutie
i 'd like to be an astrophysicist
the disadvantages are that you do n't have much time to study it 's hard to relax and i do n't know spend time with your friends in my opinion it depends really if you have a lot of money you do n't exactly need a job but if you are you know poor i 'd recommend it
you 're supposed to get to the airport really early so you can check in on time you check in of course you go to the document control and security checks your bags afterwards you wait for as long as necessary and then you get on board then you 're ready to fly
there are a bunch of programs on the internet that give you tips on studying on putting into practice your knowledge so you can get credit for tests and now with online schooling it 's even better
i speak from personal experience it is best to learn face to face with a teacher ok you are more focused you do n't have distractions popping up in your feed you 're not constantly on youtube or watching memes on reddit i do n't know it 's better face to face
patience you need a lot of patience you can learn how to make tea with calming properties you will need it believe me teamwork i guess yeah patience
i do n't know if you have good self control you can do things alone and it 's more effective for some people for others it is n't
so the more modern things are the better
i would like to study english in other countries because i think that is essential to improve in the language
i like watching t v with my girlfriend or playing football with my friends i enjoy being in good company
to travel to travel is the best way to learn english because it 's the only way to improve in the language
i would like to learn chinese or another language like japanese russian or italian for example
i think that students should work in part time jobs if they can actually it 's necessary to work and to study because they are in a hard situation what are the advantages the money the money and freedom what is the disadvantage they have less time to study
factories and vehicles produce pollution that goes up to the sky acid particles are in smoke and acid particles are carried by wind then some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water and as a result acid particles are in rain or snow and do damage to the environment
i think that eating habits are essential it is very important to have good health
doctors say that drinking water is very important for our health at any time of the day drinking water is the best option
i think that five or six hours a night is ok but there are people that need to sleep eight hours
place which i live in is safe small and quite enough it 's a small paradise you can feel that you live in a small community
i really enjoy doing many things like swimming all day long walking going out for a drink with my friends and of course having fun
when i was much younger i was n't really sure what i wanted to do in the future but now i am a teacher in a primary school i really love this job
some of the advantages are that they have more money to buy what they need they have more freedom from their parents the expenditure of their parents is less disadvantages may be like they may not have enough time to stay focused and concentrated on their studies at university my opinion is that it depends on their personal opinion
this is a presentation about travelling by airplane first of all you have to travel to the airport using your vehicle your car or the bus from a bus station when you arrive at the airport you have to show your i d or passport at security for document control then the security staff will see if your i d or passport is in order then you should wait about for some time until you 're aboard the airplane and that 's all
nowadays many students use technology as an effective way of studying and learning technology is also useful for finding any information that they need
to be honest i believe that face to face is the most important the most useful and successful way of studying and learning
for me attending lectures is a more effective of studying and learning and this is because you can learn from a teacher who gives you directions to the road to success
for me modern learning facilities at the university are so important because they give the opportunity to students to learn more effectively
i 'm very interested in other countries because i 'm interested in culture in knowing other people other countries other villages i 'm interested
normally in my free time i do sport for example i play tennis i go walking i do yoga too because i love yoga and other sports
in my opinion i need an academy because i need a teacher and to study every day because it 's very important for me to do homework every day and read
i think that i would learn japanese for example because i think that maybe is the language of the future and i think it is interesting too
nowadays i think that students need to work in part time jobs because they do n't have a lot of money to pay for their studies i think that if they work in a part time job then they have money to pay for their studies and in my opinion there are more advantages and less disadvantages
well in this graphic you can see how factories and vehicles cause pollution factories and vehicles cause pollution so these particles cause acid rain this cycle could cause damage to the environment and i think that it is very important that you help the environment
eating habits are very important if you want to be healthy
in my opinion drinking water is very important because all people need to drink a lot of water every day this is important for your health and so you do n't have illnesses
i think that it 's very important to sleep maybe not eight but at least seven or six hours at night because it 's very important for you to have a good day
i think that technology has a positive effect on people but if you use the technology a lot maybe it does n't have a positive effect
i 'm interested in learning about the u k coz i went to the u k two years ago to study english
i enjoy my free time listening to music doing some exercises and going out with friends
the best way to improve my english is to have conversations or speak with my friends because speaking involves the skills of listening and speaking
if i could learn a new skill it would be speaking italian because i have many friends in italy so i wanna speak with them
so the advantage that you get from the part time job while you are studying is that you can get money that you can spend as you like and the disadvantage is that maybe there is some possibility you wo n't wanna study you lose motivation and my opinion is you should do some part time jobs because i 've been doing it and i can get money and can spend money
so first factories and vehicles release a lot of pollution and secondly acid particles are in smoke from the pollution which is going to the air and third acid particles are carried by wind and fourth acid particles mix with cloud water and finally acid particles are in rain or snow and they cause some damage to the environment
what i can advise you is that you should think about the p f c balance you can get protein fat and carbohydrates
in my opinion doing exercise is not necessary every day but we should do it five days a week because doing some exercise is very good for our health
yeah i also think the majority of people should get eight hours ' sleep but some only need two three hours or something
i think technology has very good sides but for health i think it 's not good because before you sleep you should n't look at your smartphone because of the blue light
i love learning about countries
i usually read books and play computer games
i think speaking is the best way to improve my english
i want to learn to play the piano
i think doing part time jobs while we are studying is necessary the advantage is you can have some money you can spend your time better the disadvantage is you will be tired
while factories are making goods they are making pollution the acid particles are in smoke and then they are carried in the air by wind while they are in the air some particles fall as dust other acid particles are mixing with cloud water and the acid particles are going to fall as snow or rain that acid rain is damaging to the environment
i think we should eat healthy food we should eat vegetables or fruits and we should n't eat fast food
i think water is so important and we should drink eight or ten glassrs of water every day
i think we should do exercises at home or we can go for a walk in the park
i think sleeping is very important too and i agree that we should sleep about eight hours
i think technology has a negative effect on people and we should n't use technology very much
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries especially i am very interested in historical things and events and people
i like reading especially historical books which are my favourite books and so i spend my free time going to the library and looking for books and reading
i believe i need to have a chance to speak english because in my division all the people are japanese and so i do n't have contact with english in my work
i want to improve my knowledge of control engineering because my major is control engineering and i wish to get a p h d degree in this area
i totally agree with the opinion that all university students should do part time jobs i believe that it 's a positive thing for students to do part time jobs because they can get work experience and money to buy something for their studies on the other hand there are some negative aspects first it 's a fact that they lose time for studying the duty of a student is to study and so that 's a very large demerit in conclusion i think all university students should do part time jobs
i would like to talk about how pollution causes acid rain first take a look at this diagram and after that the acid particles in smoke move up to the sky and acid particles are carried by wind and some fall as dust the others mix with cloud water eventually acid particles are in rain or snow and fall down to the ground and damage the environment
i believe drinking a lot of water is very important especially in summer there are high temperatures in summer and our body mainly consists of water
i totally agree with the statement
i totally agree with the opinion that everyone needs at least eight hours sleep every day because in my case actually i spend six hours sleeping every day
in my opinion generally technology has a positive impact on people because we can easily get information by using the internet
i enjoy spending my free time dancing traditional mexican dances this is what i love i do it every weekend and i love it
the best way to improve my english is watching some series or listening to music i do it every day and sometimes i call my friends and we start talking in english
i would want to learn to work in teams because i 'm really impatient so i need to work on that and ensure that other people do their work
well i think that students doing part time jobs have some advantages some disadvantages of doing that are that they have less time for themselves and it 's a really hard life because there is n't enough time in my own opinion i think that this is a good way to start in the business area
okay first industries make pollution and acid particles travel with the smoke then the acid particles are carried by the wind and some of them fall as dust other particles mix with the clouds and when it rains or snows these fall like acid particles in the environment and this could be very critical for everyone
drinking water is really important for people because this way you can stay healthy and you can refresh your brain and apart from that this makes you function
yeah doing exercise every day is really important because this way you can stay stable and if this is mixed with some good eating habits you will be fit and lose some fat
yeah sleeping at least eight hours it 's good because this way your body can rest during these hours
well actually technology has a positive effect on the life of people because people staying in their house could start doing some exercise
i 'm very keen on learning about other cultures because for me it is interesting to see how other people from different parts of the world live and the way they live is very interesting for me and i can find out more interesting and useful things to learn for example it 's very interesting for me
in my free time i enjoy going for a run in the forest or in the park where i can get fresh air and find interesting animals or plants and i also play tennis with my best friends in the sports hall and another thing i travel a lot in my spare time
the best way to improve my english is to go abroad where i can meet a lot of native speakers and they can help me improve my english and at the same time i can get a lot of information about the culture where the language is spoken and the way people live in that country
if i want to improve my skills i will choose communication skills because it 's very important nowadays to communicate effectively for example if you have a problem you need to explain it properly to people to make them understand your problem
it is very important to do part time jobs while you are studying if you have enough time of course and the advantage of this is that you can get a lot of experience at work and see how it works with working in teams for example and you can also achieve goals in many areas such as sharing ideas with others and get feedback from experienced workers and the disadvantage of this is that you have a lot of tasks for university studies and for this you need a lot of time so in this situation part time jobs would n't be suitable and in my opinion many students should try it because it is very useful
well first of all factories produce products and while they are producing them they also produce dangerous elements which go up into the air and this causes a lot of pollution and then the next step is that acid particles are in smoke and the next stage is acid particles are carried by wind and then the wind carries them in the air to other places and the fourth stage is that some acid particles fall as dust the fifth stage is other acid particles mix with cloud water the next step is acid particles are in rain or snow and other problems with pollution are caused by vehicles many forms of transport are used by many factories and other companies and so we should reduce the transport
well first of all they should eat more fruit and vegetables as they contain a lot of vitamins which can improve their health and in the morning people can have cereals for breakfast and they should drink a lot of juice as well
it 's very important to drink lots of water because our body needs it to stay alive and to be more active for this we need a lot of water and we should drink it as it 's life
and everyone needs exercise to be more active and develop physically
i think that everyone needs at least eight hours of sleep a day because our brain needs the rest after a busy day
generally speaking in my opinion technology has a positive impact on our life because nowadays we can easily get information from the internet for example and from other resources as well and we can save our lives
well actually i enjoy watching t v sometimes i go out with my friends to play soccer and i play the guitar and yeah that 's it
well i think with my sister because she is just kinda my age and we 've got the same taste
well i think the advantage would be that the students could earn their own money and so they could buy anything that they need and the disadvantage could be that they ca n't study and maybe they get stressed because they are working and studying at the same time well in my opinion the students should be working and studying at the same time because they can get money
well first of all you have to get any means of transport for example get on the bus then that will take you to the airport and you have to check in then it will be document control and the security will maybe stop you to find out about you and something like this then you have to wait for a moment and then the plane will board
i think students use the internet because on the internet there is everything and they can research any topic and they can learn about everything
yeah i think so because having a teacher with you is the best way to learn any topic because you have a teacher who can help you with any question that you have
well i think they could do their homework faster yeah and make friends and get along well
it 's very important that universities should have the best learning facilities because university is the highest level school i think so
i have a son and i like to spend my time with him and with my husband and also i like to spend time with my friends and i have a small piece of land in the countryside and i like to work in my garden
the best way i think is with a teacher or if i have the opportunity to go abroad because you have the opportunity to practice with people
and there are lot of people that know this language
i believe that it 's important that all the students spend some time in a part time job while they are students because when you are working you learn different things to what you are studying you learn what real life is like and you have the opportunity to be responsible in your work and this is important for your future also you can learn about something that is involved in your studies and with this work you can get other knowledge which is different to that you are learning in class
i 'm going to explain how acid rain is produced as we can see in this picture we have a lot of factories and vehicles that produce pollution then these particles fall down to the rainforest as rain or snow and because of this they damage the environment also some of these acid particles fall as dust and i think it 's important to reduce this pollution to avoid problems like that
i would tell these people that they should eat more vegetables or fruits than other foods like fast food or something like that because these foods are better than the other ones
in my opinion it 's important to do exercise and not only eat good food and drink enough water
i think technology is not positive for your health because the waves that it produces are not good for people
so my hometown is a very international city
nowadays i usually go abroad to travel i like travelling all over the world and enjoy a lot of culture there for example local foods and talking with local people
i spend my time with my dog he likes me very much so i always walk with him and often play with him
so in that job i can get a lot of skills
the advantages if students pay the university studies is the students can choose everything if their parents pay for it students have to follow their educational policy next the disadvantage of this idea is if students work very hard they do n't have enough time to concentrate on their studies it prevents them from doing in depth learning so in my opinion the most important thing for students is study so students have to concentrate on their studies and get skills that help them in their future then they can get a lot of money
i would like to talk about how to travel by airplane first you have to go to the airport by car train or the bus when you arrive at the airport first you have to go to the check in counter then you have to do the check in then you can get your boarding pass next you have to go to document control there your passport and some documents will be checked then you have to go to security in the security area your baggage and your luggage and also your body are checked for safety then after finishing that you can wait in the airport you can go to the cafeteria restaurant and so on
so by using that they do n't need to actually hire somebody to teach them what they do n't know they can just use the internet to find out what they need right
if it 's not face to face that 's a little bit harder right
ok with group projects you can learn about cooperation and also by doing group projects you can get your own part so you have your own responsibility to finish whatever you need for the project right
attending lectures is more effective than reading alone because there is a part of you that wants to go in to see and somebody is actually talking to you it is better than you just reading from a book that somebody wrote
i think it is very important for universities to provide modern facilities because students who are going to university will need them and if they do n't have that kind of modern facilities well there 's not much point in going to university at all
i enjoy spending my free time with my friend playing catchball with my friend in the park nearby and exercise is very good for good health
i think i am similar to my mother it 's because my mother she likes talking i like talking too so we are very similar and she is a very nice woman
i would like to talk about whether schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes first about the advantages i think it is doing exercise it is very important for them to exercise because they 'll become healthier so in my opinion i think all students should do fitness classes it can be healthy
i would like to talk about how honey is produced first bees collect nectar from flowers second bees make honey from nectar in beehives and third beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives then they collect the honey in bottles finally they carry the bottles by car and display the merchandise so in conclusion i think it is very very delicious honey i think it is nice thank you
i think it is useful for work in the future i have a second language it is very useful for working in new places
i think at first they have to speak another country 's language which is very difficult so they can study english very well every day
i think so too
i enjoy spending my free time watching t v series i think i spend quite a lot of time watching t v serials like my favourite t v serial is big bang theory
i think the best way is speaking with my sister and with other people so i can improve my pronunciation and also watching t v series on the t v to learn new words
i think i would like to learn how to write but write a book or something like that because i think i am the worst at writing
i think students should do part time jobs because some advantages are that you can learn new skills you can have more experience and also you can create new relationships for your work and maybe for your personal life and some disadvantages are that maybe like a student you do n't have a lot of time and if you have a job and also you need to study it 's gon na be difficult and for that you can forget about other relationships like your parents and things like that and i think it 's the worst idea to lose those relationships because you 're focused only on your job and on studying but i think it 's the best way to have experience of real work
as we can see in the presentation factories create that pollution and also vehicles and they create that pollution that creates acid particles that are in the form of smoke and then those particles are in the air because of the vehicles and factories and that causes acid particles to mix with cloud water and that water as we can see is useful for the trees but when those acid particles are in the rain they affect those plants because they need water and water is something that is essential for the planet
for example they do n't eat well because they do n't know how to cook or maybe what food they should buy
i think drinking lots of water is important because our body needs that
not every day maybe three or five days a week because our body needs to rest and it 's something that a lot of people have a different opinion about because they think they need to exercise every day
i think we need to sleep like eight hours because our body needs to rest and if we do n't sleep enough it 's gon na be difficult for us to have a good day the next day when we wake up
and also there are some apps that motivate people to do excercise and drink water
i 'm not really sure because every time of the year has good things and bad things but i think i 'd say summer which is the time of the year when i can go to the swimming pool with my friends or to the beach to do more things
well it 's a bad point from my point of view but i 'm not interested in news i see the news on the t v while i 'm eating because i eat with my father but i do n't read the newspaper and i do n't listen to the radio so i 'm not interested in the news
i loved going to the park with my friends who were my friends from school and also my neighbours because all of us lived like in the same area of the city
i 'd like to maybe be the boss of a big company and maybe work abroad because i do n't think i 'd be able to work here in spain so i 'd like to work in a big company with international issues maybe exports or imports
i think practical work experience it 's really important before graduating but not all the courses should practice this because for example in a first year course you are just giving students the first notions of what they are studying so they are not ready to have the responsibility of doing any work for any practical work experience so from my point of view it 's important but it 's only in the final courses like in the third or fourth year of the degree that they know what should they do if they have a problem in a work setting
okay so in this graph we can see three music sites so the first one is tunes net tunes net starts with twenty thousand people then the second one is music now music now started high and remains high but well it has increased but it is still lower than the red line
and you do not need to be the boss you do n't have to give orders you have to involve the team and work with them maybe work more than them
but if there are less people you have to do more work per person so i think in a way it 's good to manage but it 's bad because you have to work more
i think it 's very good and very healthy to have different opinions and different points of view because like that we can do a better job and we can share ideas more than if we all agree but i do n't think it 's really good though
i think it does n't have to be face to face in order to be effective i mean you can do an online meeting or whatever but i think it 's better to do it face to face because you can see others ' ideas more clearly
i totally agree with that statement because if you are working in teams another person could have a better idea that you have n't even thought of so i think it 's really good to have other points of view to share your ideas and maybe you 'll be better in other areas
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries and other cultures i think it 's always interesting to know about a culture very different from your own
i enjoy spending my free time watching t v series or playing games or reading a book i also like to go to football matches with my friends
well in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing speaking or watching series or playing games in english or reading a book in english so practice is the best way to improve my english in my opinion
i would love to learn to paint so i could paint my own pictures and hang them in my house and maybe even give them to my friends
i 'm going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of students doing part time jobs while they are studying in my opinion one advantage will be that working at the same time as studying gives you a sense of responsibility about your life because you have to provide for yourself but on the other hand i think that working at the same time that you are studying could affect your academic life negatively because maybe you 're too tired after working to start studying properly so it will affect your grades so in my opinion there are some advantages to working while you 're studying but maybe the disadvantages are worse
i 'm going to give a little talk about acid rain acid rain forms firstly when the pollution emitted from factories goes into the air in the form of particles that are in the smoke then those particles are carried by the wind some of those particles fall as dust polluting lakes and our forests the rest of those particles mix with the cloud water and then form clouds and when those clouds rain or snow the acid particles go into the soil polluting our trees and our forests and our lakes
well i think that the advice i will give to people who want to improve their eating habits will be do not skip any meal and try to replace as much meat as you can with vegetables to try to reduce the meat you eat
oh i think it 's very important to drink a lot of water you should try to drink at least two liters of water per day
well maybe not every day but at least three four times a week you should do exercise there 's no need to do any heavy exercise you could also just go for a walk or try some light exercise at least try to move every day
oh i completely agree that we need eight hours of sleep every night problem is that you ca n't always get them because you maybe have to get up early in the morning to go to work or study so it 's always complicated but definitely you should try to sleep at least eight hours
well honestly i think that technology has had a bad impact on our lifestyle because it 's made people more sedentary and they move less eat worse maybe work at home
i would definitely say that my favourite time of year is christmas because everyone is together we have some holidays
when i was seven years old i was a couch potato i enjoyed being on a sofa watching cartoons
as i said before i would love to work as a teacher because i studied my degree for four years to be a teacher and i would love to be the best teacher ever
it was my vocation
from the graph relating to the new online pop music sites that people were visiting during their first week online we can see that music now was the most popular and on the other hand tunes net started as the least popular one but it was the most popular on the last day ok
from my personal point of view i think it has to be someone with an open mind who motivates their workers
one of the most common problems with work in teams is the fact that some people are lazy and they avoid focusing on their work
absolutely i think we have to be open minded in order to work with different people because everyone can have a different view so we have to listen to everybody and try to change our work until it 's perfect
not necessarily currently we are working in a problematic situation that means we have to do our work online i think that with some applications we can share our feelings our opinions
i could n't agree more because from a personal point of view i think you can always learn from your partners because they do n't think like you so they can have more creative ideas
i 'm really keen on the environment because in the future if we do n't look after the environment we wo n't have enough water to drink or something like that
we are unalloyed fans of the cinema in fact every weekend we usually go to the cinema
definitely i take after my grandfather in fact everyone says that i am his son
in the future i would like to live somewhere else but i do n't know where exactly but at the moment i 'd choose england i think
i could n't agree more with this sentence because sport is one of the most important things to make you feel healthy and with energy in fact when you 're doing sport you feel over the moon and you will have more energy to study or do anything the only disadvantage that i can see with this idea is that you wo n't have so much time to learn about other subjects like maths and languages or history or similar
at the beginning bees collect nectar from the flowers in the country after that these bees make honey from the nectar in beehives and so beekeepers can collect the honey from those beehives after that they manufacture the honey and they distrubute this honey in different shops so that the customers can buy it
there are a lot of advantages but the most important one from my point of view is that you will able to learn another language
to learn about the local culture they must meet new people from this country to learn more about their food or relationships and language
i could n't agree more with this advice because you must be independent to live in another country because you will be alone and you must to do everything by yourself
i am interested in other languages and other countries ' cultures
usually i watch some movies on netflix and i go walking near the river and i listen to music
i think the best way is speaking with native people and reading some thing in english
i want to learn to speak a few languages easily and also i want to learn to play some musical instruments
i think it has some good aspects if you are working while at university you can earn money for yourself and you can be independent also you feel so self confident and of course there are some disadvantages you do not have much time for entertainment or hanging out with friends and you can feel exhausted
factories and vehicles cause pollution and the pollution has some acid particles in smoke the acid particles are carried by wind in the sky and they cause some acid rain some of the acid particles fall as dust on the earth some of them mix with cloud water and acid particles are in rain or snow and this cycle this acid rain cycle damages the environment
people who want to have a healthy lifestyle should eat some vegetables and fruits regularly
in my opinion people should do exercise every day because doing exercise can be good for the body 's health
i agree with this view because our bodies are tired during the day so we need to rest our bodies
it can change it depends on people 's usage
this is my hometown
on my holiday i usually spend my time with my mum and my dad we usually go to the beach and sunbathe
i think that 's with my mum she is very lovely and we have fun she also gives me some useful advice for my problems
i 'd like to become a teacher because i love children and i want to help them to broaden their knowledge and i want to help them to gain some social skills to prepare for their future
nowadays many people believe that all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies there are both advantages and disadvantages for this first of all if students get jobs they can earn their living and also get more money for their study expenses and they can also pay their study fees but if they spend most of their time doing a part time job it can impact badly on their studies
the diagram illustrates the stages people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all they need to go to the airport by any means of transportation they can get such as car bus or train and after that when they reach the airport they should go to the check in desk and show their passport and something like that in document control after that they should check their luggage their suitcase with the security employee
yes i support this idea nowadays even when we study online we come across some problems especially if our technology is not good enough
of course it 's more interesting to attend lectures than to read some material some documents alone because we can hear a voice
the place where i live is very nice because the people have a lot of facilities and also the place has a lot of culture and touristic places
when i am on holiday i love to go away on vacation and go to the beach with my family and also i enjoy reading books about architecture
i enjoy spending time with my brother because he 's very funny and also i love being with my father but i prefer being with my brother because he is very spontaneous
well i do n't really see myself doing the same job as i 'm doing now because i would really like to keep on improving and to keep on being promoted and be one of the best architects
so i think it 's an advantage if you can do both but it 's a disadvantage because you need the time to learn in the university
in my opinion as students we need to use technology to improve our skills and also to improve our knowledge
i prefer to work alone but the group projects i know help us to be a leader and also to understand how other options could be good
i think that the way everyone learns is very different so i think the learning facilities will change because everyone has their manner to learn
i am very interested in learning about other countries and cultures
i enjoy spending my free time with my kids with my husband my family and i love also reading books watching series on netflix and eating a good meal with my family
i would love to learn embroidery and i would love to improve my study skills
we see many university students working part time jobs while they are studying and i think there are many advantages to that students firstly would have their own income and that would allow them some financial independence from their parents as well as becoming more responsible in their money management the disadvantage though is if they need to work while attending classes as they would have to manage their time between their work duties and their university responsibilities in my opinion it 's better if the university students do part time work while they are studying but i would advise them to do so during their summer breaks as they would get the best of both worlds
one of the many problems caused by air pollution is certainly acid rain in areas where there are many factories and vehicles they can release a lot of pollution into the air that contains acid particles that go up in the form of the smoke these acid particles are carried by the wind and some of them fall as dust but others get mixed with clouds and they can in turn fall in the form of rain or snow causing damage to the environment such as crops and water supplies
the first advice on eating is start to include your five a day in your diet and another very important step is to cut out junk food and sugary foods from your meals try to stick to three meals a day and healthy snacks in between
experts say we should aim to drink about two liters of water a day it 's very important to keep our bodies hydrated and functioning well so it 's important to keep our bodies hydrated
i do n't think it 's essential to do exercise every day i think it 's important to have a regular and consistent routine experts say we should exercise three days a week and i think that would be a good aim
i would n't say everyone needs eight hours ' sleep per night i know that i work better if i have between eight and nine hours ' sleep but i know some people that can not sleep any more than six or seven hours
generally speaking i think it 's a little negative but that 's because we do n't know how to control ourselves and to put limits on the amount of time we spend in front of screens be that the phone the t v or computers but if we know how to manage our time i think technology is great
well i 'm really interested in the environment and right now it is pretty sad i would say that the environment is being damaged so i definitely think that we need to take action right now to protect our environment
well we often do some sports during our free time so by doing this not only can we keep fit but also we can develop our friendship which is i think really great
i think i am mostly similar to my dad because we often read books together and we both love writing articles
well i 'd like to live in new york in the future because new york is a really multicultural city and in fact i visited new york once last year and i was really amazed by the city new york is a great city
some schools and colleges think that they should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes well there are definitely some advantages to doing this for example through doing sports not only can students keep fit but they can also learn how to do teamwork which is very important for their future career however every coin has two sides there are some disadvantages as well for example spending too much time doing sports may result in a poor academic performance so as far as i 'm concerned it is essential for students to learn how to balance schoolwork and sports only in this way can they have a better future
hi everyone today we are going to talk about how honey is made well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and then they make honey from nectar in beehives after several days beekeepers collect honey from beehives and then they put it into jars and once this procedure is done these jars will be put onto the vehicles and they will be delivered to supermarkets all around the country where you can buy them and take them home and enjoy them so this is how honey is made this is how honey goes from flowers to the shop that 's all thank you
well students need to consider a lot of things to choose a country for example they may consider whether they like the food in those countries whether the weather is great and so on there is a lot to consider
well i think foreign students may find it difficult to make friends or fit in with local students because they grew up in two different cultures and the cultural difference can prevent them from being together
well i think foreign students can ask local students to share something about their unique culture because those local students have lived in that country for many years and they definitely have a deeper understanding of their culture
well studying abroad can definitely help a student become independent because in a foreign country there are no relatives and you need to solve all the problems on your own it 's really challenging but it can also benefit you a lot
when i am on holiday i enjoy relaxing of course i enjoy swimming at the beach or at the swimming pool for example or going out and visiting the city where i am staying
normally i enjoy spending time with my brother because we have similar interests so every day we play video games together
i would like to get a job as an occupational therapist actually i am studying for that but i would like to get a job as a physiotherapist too it 's one of my dreams so i would like to do that
in my opinion it 's reasonable that students get jobs to pay for their university studies because actually university studies are very expensive the advantage is that you will earn money easily because you are working the disadvantage is that you have n't got a lot of time to prepare your subjects in the university so you have less time than others in my opinion it 's reasonable because university studies are very expensive but it 's very hard to do this
firstly you need to travel to the airport and go to do the check in when you are waiting you can have something to drink or eat or go to the toilets and when they call you to board the plane you will take off and go where you want to go
i think that it 's a good option for understanding all the doubts that you have for example if you do n't understand something in relation to the unit that you are studying a teacher could help you
i think that attending lectures is a good option for understanding things that you do n't know for example if you do n't understand what the teacher has said attending a lecture will help you with that
universities want to improve these modern learning facilities because thanks to them the students can understand all the information more easily
my favourite time of the year is absolutely christmas i really love the atmosphere but also the cold the weather like snow also rain i really like rain well i think it 's the best time of the year
i think it 's really important to read the news like the local ones newspapers but also on the web on the internet
when i was a child i really loved i really liked being in touch with nature i was always outside outdoors playing ball and i do n't know maybe skipping
well i would like to become an engineer in particular a biomedical one
i completely agree with the idea that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience indeed i think that the main advantage of including a period of practical work experience is the fact that probably after this practical work experience students can find a job and they also improve their practical abilities i think well the main disadvantage of this idea is the fact that probably people will think that it 's like a waste of time because they ca n't study while they are working well in my opinion i would like to include a period of practical work during my studies
this graph shows the number of people visiting these three different sites tunes net music now songs for you during their first week online we can see that on the vertical axis there are the numbers of thousands of people and the days of the week are shown on the horizontal one we can see that from the fifth day to the seventh day tunes net had an increase and there is a drop for songs for you and a slight drop for music now
i think that the main characteristics of a team leader are ambition also cooperativeness and enthusiasm i think that these three are the most important characteristics of team leaders
i think there is only one problem with a small team well the fact that if a group is small probably there are few ideas and this is a disadvantage
i think that the most important thing is collaboration obviously members ca n't always agree with the ideas of other members but it 's important to come to a resolution
yeah i think that it 's very important to create a face to face team rather than an online group i think that a face to face team could create more collaboration
i completely agree with this sentence i think that the best results for a group are possible only if they collaborate and they are open minded and they accept others ' ideas
i always eat dinner or go shopping with my family and at the weekend we chat with each other to understand what has been going on
i think it 's my mom i always share my daily life with my mom and then she always provides me with some suggestions so we are very familiar with this
and in my opinion i think i agree that students should have fitness classes when they are at school because they can then be more focused in the next class
honey from flower to shop the first thing is that bees collect nectar from flowers and the bees make honey from the nectar in beehives and after that the beekeeper collects the honey from the beehives and the beekeepers make the honey and they put the honey into a jar and after that there is a car to deliver the honey to the shop so the shop sells the honey
i think the language is an important thing if a student wants to learn english then he or she will choose an english speaking country
the advantage of studying a second language is that he or she has more languages communication skills to communicate with others
and for example for the festival it can be for another type of local culture
i totally agree that a student studying abroad can be independent because students need to do everything by themselves
it has a river it has a beach the beach is near to the town and also the sunset there is amazing
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy swimming in the pool and also playing music i enjoy improving my skills with my instrument my favourite instruments are guitar and drums
i play with it i eat with it
well one advantage that i found to getting a job to pay for the university studies is that it makes the students more independent so apart from paying the university they also buy everything they want but one disadvantage is they maybe spend more time in their job than on their studies so in my opinion if they have the time to work to get a job to invest time in their job they can do it but if they do n't have this time it 's better if they just focus on their studies
nowadays technology is one of the most important tools for learning because we can find a lot of information on the internet
from my experience i think that it is correct because now with the online classes learning is more difficult and i think face to face is better
one skill that i consider all students can develop is teamwork for their jobs teamwork is an important skill that they can learn and build
well it depends on each student for example for me it 's more effective to read alone because i do n't get distracted by other things but for other students it 's more effective to read in groups
it 's important but maybe not the most important thing
on holiday i enjoy playing tennis with my friends dancing and other things that when i study i do n't do
i think with my brother he is two years older than me i love to pass time with him
the advantage of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies is certainly that they can pay for their studies but if they work they wo n't have time to study if they do n't study they wo n't pass their degree
first people travel to the airport by car bus train or other means of transport in the airport first people check in and pass document control and security then people wait in a cafe or visit stores or other facilities
in my opinion it 's best to learn face to face with the teacher but i think too that it 's important to supplement that with books or by searching for information on the internet
i think that by attending lectures the students learn different things that alone they do n't get to learn
it 's important because the world is changing and the students need modern learning facilities to learn more and do different things in the future
i really love her i think she 's one of the most important people in my life she 's taught me so much and i really enjoy spending time with her
in the future i would like to become a classical philology teacher because i really love like showing my knowledge to the students
in my opinion it 's great that some students want to get jobs to pay for their university studies i think that is a great way to gain experience and earn money in order to help them pay their university fees but also on the other hand i think that if they get a job they are wasting time on doing it like going to work when they should be or could be studying and in my opinion like you know if they have enough money to pay their university fees without troubling their family i think they would n't have to get a job if they do n't wanna but if they do need the money i think it 's a great idea
hello today i 'm going to explain to you how to travel by airplane first of all you get to the airport then once you are there you should do the check in after that you go to document control where a guard should check your documents and see everything is clear and in order and valid and after that you just have to wait and when they tell you to you should board the plane and get ready because the airplane will take off soon
well i think using technology is a great way to improve your studying techniques
i think that human interaction ca n't be replaced by technology so i think face to face interaction with a teacher is best it 's the best way to learn
i think that by working on group projects students learn how to co operate how to share and divide work in order to get something done faster
in my opinion if the person who is giving the lecture is a good speaker i think attending lectures is the best way to get the information right and to understand everything
i think the university should adapt to the world as it 's growing and improving
i am very interested in learning about other countries ' culture because it is very interesting for me to learn about other things other customs traditions
when i have free time i like watching t v or watching youtube videos tiktok or watching a series
the method that i use is to practice four skills listening speaking writing and reading these four skills for me are very important to improve my skills in english
actually i want to learn how to play another instrument i actually know how to play the piano and i also sing and i want to learn a new language that is korean i want to travel to south korea
i think that the advantage of doing part time jobs while you are a student is that you can be prepared for real life and the problems which have solutions one disadvantage is that the students need to organise their time very well to study and do part time jobs and i think that university students should n't do part time jobs because they need to concentrate on what they are studying
hi everyone the first step in creating acid rain is pollution then acid particles are in smoke and they are carried by the wind some of the acid particles fall as dust and other particles mix with cloud water and that is how acid rain is formed and we can find some acid particles in rain and snow
a recommendation that i can give the person is that if he or she wants she can go or he can go to a nutritionist to get tips on his or her eating habits
well in my opinion it is very important because our body is made up of seventeen percent water so that is why all doctors recommend us to drink almost two liters of water a day
well some recommendations from my point of view doing exercises every day it 's an option but you can also do them twice or three times a week
sleep time is very important because that is when we recharge our batteries or our energies it is highly recommended by doctors to sleep almost eight hours
so in summer we usually just bike down to the beach and it 's really sunny here but sometimes it 's a bit windy and it 's blowing really hard the wind is really harsh
i really enjoy spending time with other family members but also i like to swim play go shopping and eat lots of food i really love tasting other types of food from other countries
i think that 's going to be my sister since both of my parents they are a lot older than us of course
i do n't know at the moment but i 'm thinking about becoming a doctor but i 'm thinking about it because you know to become a doctor you have to study a lot it 's a lot of math and it 's just really hard so i 'm still thinking about it
if there are many jobs that are available this is a really great opportunity for all students to get jobs to pay for their university studies but some students do also have parents who pay for their university studies which is not as good the disadvantage is as i mentioned before if you are working while you 're studying at the same time it can affect your grades in a bad way and in my opinion it 's good to get a job to pay for your university studies so that you do n't have to borrow money from your parents or the bank yeah it 's not good to borrow money but it 's not good either if you 're failing your tests
so before you travel by airplane of course you have to travel to the airport first so you can choose between going by car bus or train i recommend taking a bus or train because if you 're driving a car to the airport you have to pay for the parking so obviously it 's not worth it if you 're paying for a ticket when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and you will go through document control and security with your baggage and then you can just wait at the airport perhaps go to the toilet eat some food and buy some gifts and when your plane has arrived it 's time to board and then you just wait for your airplane to start flying up in the sky
you can go to websites to get feedback you can write using computers which is much easier than writing on paper but i recommend writing on paper because you will remember the text a lot better
i think the same during this pandemic we have been having online classes the whole time and it has been a lot harder to understand what teachers are talking about when you 're asking questions it 's also a lot harder for them to understand when you are not face to face
you know you can take ideas from others and build your own
sometimes yeah it depends on like which subject and what it is about but attending lectures is a really good way compared to studying alone because lectures are not available the whole time but you can always study by yourself so if you have the chance do it
i think it 's really important for the students to have a great modern learning facility for them to concentrate and a facility that works for everyone and that will be silent modern technology for everyone to use
barcelona is so beautiful it 's amazing but in my opinion i think there is so much pollution and so many people
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy travelling around the world and discovering new places
with my father because we have a lot of things in common such as playing computer games
nowadays i work as a waitress but i would like to work in hospitality management
in my opinion we have a lot of advantages of working and studying at the same time for example you will be more efficient more organised you will appreciate your spare time as well and of course earning money is so difficult nowadays you have to appreciate it the disadvantage is the time you will have no time to be with your family or with your friends or to do the things you really love
good morning today i am going to explain what you need to do to travel by airplane to get to the airport is not very difficult quite the opposite it 's simple you need to get there by bus by car or by train once you are there you have to do the check in and leave your big suitcase then you will pass document control where you have to be ready with your i d and your passport if everything is ok you will go to the security where a guard will check your belongings and then all you have do is wait you can have a coffee you can go shopping you can go to the bathroom have some food and then thirty minutes before departure you will go to your gate you will get onto your plane and all you have to do is enjoy your journey
i reckon google is a really good app to search for different information and to learn new things but just if you know how to use it so i suggest searching on different websites
i reckon face to face is much better because based on my opinion and i am studying a master 's online it 's so difficult when you have doubts i have to write an email and wait one day until someone replies to my email
although i think of myself as an individual person i know that working in groups is much better because you have new ideas you are more efficient you can talk with more people it 's better
in my opinion i think it 's much better reading alone because for me i hate reading with noise around me or someone who is talking about another thing or different kinds of noises it 's so annoying
the world is changing day to day and we ca n't stay in the past this is the way that we are going to learn new things obviously
a lovely country style cottage
vacation maybe around the world
of course my mother my father my brother and younger sister
a dentist a doctor a teacher or maybe a firefighter
working while studying can be a great way for you to make a little bit of extra money although it does have its disadvantages those are usually heavily outweighed by the benefits that it brings that is probably why nearly eighty percent of students work part time while studying of course it 's not necessarily the right decision for everyone and there 's a real risk that if you spend a lot of time working and not enough time studying you may not achieve the grade that you were aiming for as with most things in life the key to success is to have a healthy balance which is why it 's a good idea to limit your working hours if you do decide to take on a job while studying but we recommend it if you can and here 's why
travelling by airplane before you are at the airport you have to travel to the airport by public transport and then after that the next process will be document control they have staff there to help to check all the documents and then you have a security check you need to wait at the gate and then have some time to wait during the wait maybe you can go to the washroom and then go shopping and then have lunch there after that you will go on board so when on board you can depart so
you will be able to concentrate better on your learning because there will be less distractions than if you were at home
personal training provides better opportunities for group activities and interactive projects individuals will find they learn more working with others who really want to take as many traditional classes as possible face to face interaction can also provide more networking opportunities
the basic facilities that every school should provide for the students are ventilation and air quality lighting temperature control space and a good size of classroom
i 'm interested in the environment because for example in my country there is a lot of pollution
well my friends and me sometimes go to the cafe because it is very relaxing and comfortable
she has glasses like me
in the future i 'd like to live in malaga this is a big city in the south of andalucia in this city also there are a lot of people and a lot of shopping centres
i think that is a good idea and one advantage is the students can be more relaxed and comfortable for their other subjects in the school or university
i am going to explain how to make honey in the first place the bees collect nectar from flowers then some bees make honey from the nectar in the beehive and a man or woman who is a beekeeper collects honey from the hive after the man or woman puts the honey in jars
i am studying a second language this is english because it is necessary for me in my university studies
i think that the most difficult part of studying in another country is you ca n't see your family but in this country you can make a new friend
well i think that the local culture is very important because you can eat a lot of food in this country and it 's very interesting to know the local culture because the people are very happy in this country
i enjoy learning about the culture of the country it 's something that interests me a lot
i like to read in my free time
for me it 's important to learn every day at least one word because it will help me to improve my vocabulary that is really important
it would be better communication because for me it 's really important for everything
the advantage is that the person will have more experience and will be more responsible and will have more opportunities and the disadvantage is the time because the person will have no time to do other things and that can harm their mental health
hello today i 'll talk about acid rain let 's go first vehicles and factories cause pollution then acid particles are in smoke and acid particles are carried by wind then some acid particles fall as dust and after that other acid particles mix with cloud water and finally acid particles are in rain or snow and it 's just this but it 's a really important topic
firstly what you want is really essential
it 's important for our body because our body is composed of a lot of water and it 's really important to good health
for me it 's really important to have a better disposition and a good routine in the day
for me balance is everything to do better things with technology
that 's a very beautiful city and its culture is very good
in my holidays i prefer to go travelling to other countries
i spend most of my time with my mother i love to stay with my mother she is my icon actually
all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies about this topic i think the advantage is that it can promote independence in the students to live by themselves but the disadvantage is that students do n't have time to focus on their studies so it maybe influences the result of their academic performance
so here are several steps you need to take when you 're travelling by airplane first you can travel to the airport by any transportation you like after arriving in the airport you should check in first and then go through document control after security you need to wait for the plane to arrive after that you can board the airplane and then you just wait for the plane to take off
i think students can use computers and surf the internet to learn about some topics they are interested in that will be very effective
well it depends that will be it
by doing group projects people can learn a lot of new knowledge and new ways of thinking from the other students and that 's a very good model for their learning
in my opinion going to the classroom and attending lectures is more effective than reading alone at home because if you come across some problem you can raise your hand and ask questions immediately
i think it 's very important for a university to provide modern highly advanced technology for learning facilities so students can learn some new knowledge very effectively
when i am on my holiday i enjoy travelling to other countries and doing something i 've never done
the job i would like to have in the future is flexible and one which i can do at my pace
and the disadvantage is they ca n't concentrate on their future studies so in my opinion they can have both but they should concentrate on their studies rather than work
i will explain the process when you travel by airplane firstly you should travel to the airport by car by bus or by tube then you should check in with the flight staff and you should submit your passport a valid passport to the document control staff and also you should be checked by the security guard you wait till you board your airplane and that 's it
well some people say face to face learning is very effective
i think attending lectures is as important as reading a book by yourself
well provision of modern learning facilities at university is not so important for me because you can study anywhere
well it 's a difficult question to answer because i love christmas and summer but if i have to choose between one of them i would say summer and i think that for several reasons because when it 's summer i am on vacation so i spend a lot of time on the beach and with my family
to tell you the truth it 's super important in fact every day when i wake up in the morning and i go to the office i try to listen to the radio and i always try to find newspapers as well as trying to use twitter for news
well when i was a child i used to go to the beach given that i spent a lot of time with my cousins who were living in another city and with my grandparents let 's say that it was the perfect time to have all the family close and to spend a lot of time with them
that 's a difficult question to answer i would like to know but i would like to work in an embassy or consulate i 'm striving to improve my english to get this job i hope everything works out well for me
to begin with this question i would like to shed light on the suggestion that everyone should work a little while they are a student if we talk about the advantages i would say that you 're going to earn a salary and you are going to gain experience and trust me when i say that this is something crucial if we talk about the disadvantages i would say that maybe you will have to spend a lot of time working and for this reason maybe you will fail your exams or to more accurately not fail but at least maybe you will have lower grades as far as i am concerned i would say that this is an experience that i recommend to everyone it should be mandatory if you are studying for a degree because i would say that it 's quite important to get experience in a job
as we can see there is a comparison between thousands of peoples and different days it 's paramount to draw special attention to the fact that tunes net began at rock bottom however it 's going up right now and it 's at the highest level however if we speak about music now and songs four you they were higher than the present leader
this is something that is on everyone 's list but if i have to say something i would say that it 's a person who understands everyone and supports their team you know not a person who wants to show off or something like that someone who works with a team
well that 's a difficult question to answer because as you know when you are in a small team there are different people and maybe the communication is good
yes sure why not but i should say that it should always be in a polite way for example it 's not a bad thing if you disagree with someone because for example that means that you are thinking about how to improve your team
we live in a world that is very competitive and we have technology as a tool for these types of teams to work as teams but i prefer to work face to face it 's more effective
well it 's difficult to answer this question because i would give special attention to the fact that it depends on the person you are or the people who are your team for example if you are working with people who are super lazy obviously it 's better to work alone
actually i do consider myself an environmentalist because i care about sustainability and the development of cities
i would like to say we love to enjoy time together reading for example but the truth is we enjoy hanging out going to bars having drinks and maybe staying in at night watching movies
probably the person who i get along the most with is my mom because she and i have a lot of things in common we two enjoy our time together watching movies or t v shows and hanging out
i do n't have problems actually living here or there now i 'm living in malaga which is a city located by the sea so i love to live here because of the weather
i do consider that one of the advantages of giving free time to students to do fitness classes is it will help students to lose their anxiety and lower their levels of stress
after collecting it the bees go to their beehives where they produce honey after that there are some workers who specialise in collecting honey from these beehives all the honey collected is put in some jars and then they are delivered to the supermarkets there actually are different kinds of honey coming from different types of species of bees in nature
students actually consider many things as they choose which country to live in
studying a second language has a lot of advantages and one of them it 's letting people travel and know a different kind of culture and making them independent to live in another place and grow as a person
living in another country and learning and studying there it 's something that only students that are privileged can do
about the place where i live i can tell you that it 's a comfortable city not big not small you have plenty of things to do everything is near so that you do n't have to do big trips big journeys
while i 'm on holiday i enjoy trying new things visiting new places trying new food obviously if i 'm visiting a country abroad but if i can enjoy it with friends and good company that would be the key for me if i 'm on my holidays
i spend time with everyone i enjoy spending time with every single member of my family but i have to say that when i spend time with my sister i really enjoy it just because i do n't have that much time to spend with her usually so yeah i really enjoy it
i do n't know yet i think it 's too early for me to know where i want to be in the future where i want to work so i have to think about it but i think as long as i have a comfortable job with good people around me that would be a good place to work
talking about the advantages and disadvantages of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies i should say that the advantages those would be for example they would gain experience and they would learn values such as hard work and discipline in order to accomplish something and talking about on the other hand the disadvantages i think that at that age they should focus on studying and just be focused on what they want to be and to become what they want to be in the future so in my opinion i do n't think that students should get jobs in order to pay for university because it should be free in my view or cost less so everyone would be capable of getting into university
in order to travel by plane you have to follow several steps until you finally get into the plane first of all you have to travel to the airport i recommend you travel an hour and a half or two hours before you have to fly secondly it is very important to do the check in once you get to the airport before you pass several controls such as document control or security control once you 've completed all these stages which are very important in the whole process you will have time to wait until boarding so after all those steps you just have to board the plane and enjoy your trip so i would say those are the main steps
i think students can use technology to access other platforms or other options rather than books to study and be connected with people to share knowledge and notes so i think that 's very helpful
i think obviously learning face to face with a professor or teacher is a better option you get a different perspective it 's a more direct form so yeah i think it 's better in so many ways
i think the most important skill that a student can learn from group projects is to hear people listen to people and learn from them obviously other ones are sharing thoughts and respecting your teammates
of course attending lectures is more useful you listen to a professional like your teacher and you have the option of listening to the doubts of other students you interact with them
i think it 's so important to have good facilities such as a library good places for studying for students they get more involved in the university they experience the university in another different way
i am very interested in the environment i usually recycle all kinds of products at home in order to get a better world in the future
well years ago when i was younger we used to play football all together but these days we tend to go for a run
i am extremely similar to my mother not only physically but in personality as well i can understand my mother
well i really do n't mind i just want to be happy the place where i am going to live is not important for me but i guess that i would prefer living in spain my country
students are usually fat these days not only in spain but around the whole world so i think it 's essential for schools to make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes i can only see advantages in that maybe one of the disadvantages is the smell after doing fitness classes because there are not any showers in spanish schools so it could be a problem
everybody likes honey but where does it come from well first of all the animal called a bee collects nectar from flowers after that bees make honey from nectar in beehives then a human being a professional has to collect the honey from the beehives in the most natural way possible after that the honey is almost ready to be eaten
well i think that the more knowledge you have or skills you have then the more easily you will get a job in the future so it 's crucial to study in a second language
in my humble opinion it wo n't be easy in the beginning
speaking from my own experience i learnt a lot about local culture when i was studying in england
i could n't agree more with that studying abroad is essential in order to become independent
i enjoy learning about other countries especially about their culture their language their history it 's quite interesting for me
in my leisure time i like to do yoga or to make clothes i am fascinated with fashion and tailoring
i guess there are a lot of ways to improve my english for example i am studying everything on speak and improve and on write and improve
honestly i 'm not very good in establishing a rapport with other people i 'm an introvert and i 'd like to be more extrovert i 'd like to have a skill such as small talk
i think that working part time while studying helps us to be more organised to be more autonomous and it also helps us to practice what we are studying i mean that we have an opportunity to experience what we are studying and do something that we studied and as for disadvantages i think that of course it takes time and you have less time for studying and for your assignments from university
now i 'd like to tell you about acid rain about its causes about the process of its formation and about the consequences of acid rain first of all a lot of factories on our planet make a lot of pollution then this pollution is in the smoke rising to the air and with the wind it flies to clouds and it mixes with clouds and then it falls with rain or snow into our forests and on our lawns
well it 's a tricky question but first of all eat less ready made meals and eat more home prepared meals and no fast food and junk food
i heard that everybody should drink enough water and i heard a good amount is about two or three liters of water but as for me i ca n't drink so much water
as for my opinion i think that it 's of vital importance to do exercise every morning or every evening if you want to have a healthy lifestyle
i 'm not sure about eight hours of sleep but i can agree that it 's very important to have enough sleep for some people it can be just six or seven hours
i think it has both positive and negative effects and you should remember about digital hygiene and you should spend less time with your gadgets
i like to travel a lot and know different cultures
i am trying to attend courses online and reading many english books
it would be how to play tennis
in my opinion it 's good for university students to do part time jobs because it has many advantages for them like they acquire new experience make new friends but another advantage is that they learn how to be independent
acid rain is formed when the smoke from factories goes up until it reaches the sky then other acid particles mix with cloud water after that acid particles are in the rain or snow
for good eating habits it 's preferable to eat three times per day and it must be healthy food including vegetables and meat and be low in carbohydrates
drinking a lot of water keeps your body hydrated and allows you to feel fresh all the time
it is not essential to do exercise every day but at least three times per week and the duration of each session must be an hour
technology has a positive and a negative effect as a positive effect it allows them to read a lot of books on the internet
i 'd like to learn about other countries and their cultures because it would open a new window a new vision for me
i like to listen to music watch movies design user interfaces or just walk
the best way to improve my english is to speak with someone like a native speaker or someone who has enough skill to talk back to me
definitely it 's programming or web development
working for students has some advantages and disadvantages some of its advantages are the work gives them experience in some field and also it makes them ready to work in future however it has some disadvantages like maybe its effect on study because it makes them tired and there is no energy to study and finally my suggestion is that the university must have some jobs for students in a relevant field to what they study
there are lots of things that cause acid rain but most of it comes from factories ' smoke and also vehicles ' pollution first of all pollution from factories and vehicles comes to the air and acid particles combine with clouds and some of them fall as dust after a while clouds make rain and acid particles are in rain or snow falling onto the trees and ground
i think they have to eat each meal at a specific time and also they have to avoid eating junk food and eat healthy food instead of that
humans have to drink at least eight glasses of water every day
i think that 's right because if your body ca n't rest and you 're working hour after hour it makes you tired and exhausted for next day
some technology helps people to get slim and healthy but some does not
i want to know about other countries i want to learn about their history their customs their cooking and other things that they do during the day
i enjoy my free time very much reading books learning about other countries learning about other languages for example english cooking and doing watercolour painting
i watch many videos to improve my listening and this helps me to improve my speaking also the web is the most important thing to improve my spoken english
i love to learn languages so i think the most important thing that i want to do is to learn english but also in the future i want to learn french and other languages
working during university years can cut both ways many students have the advantage of earning extra money for their personal stuff also they can acquire work experience that will help them in the future but they have to concentrate on their course as a first thing to achieve unfortunately some students quit their university after they start working and earning money for other students it is impossible to work and study at the same time because of the time consumed by both tasks i believe that is very personal to each student and their circumstances working and studying is the ideal way but not many students can accomplish it
i will give you a short presentation about the formation of acid rain first of all as you can see in the diagram the smoke that is expelled from a lot of vehicles and also by huge companies contaminates the air we breathe this pollution in the form of smoke contains acid particles that are carried by the wind some of these acid particles fall to the soil as dust but other acid particles are mixed with the water in the clouds as a result these acid particles fall to the earth in rain or snow this acid rain damages the environment including the soil air water animals humans and trees consequently it causes many diseases in humans
the most important thing to maintain good health is to have a balanced diet consisting of many vegetables and fruits you can add seeds olive oil fish and sometimes meat you have to avoid salt sugars and carbohydrates please never forget to eat breakfast
people must drink eight glasses of water every day depending on their height and weight some people have to drink more or less depending on their daily level of activity
in my opinion doing exercise at least two or three days a week for thirty minutes helps us to have a healthy cardiovascular and respiratory system it also helps us to stay active and motivated even on bad days exercise can eliminate daily stress
i totally agree if you sleep a minimum of eight hours a day you are happier to face the next day also you will concentrate better at work
technology helps us to have more time to spend with our family and friends also now we have more information and news from around the world in minutes you can read or learn about everything you want with just one click you can also communicate with your family
i 'm really interested in the environment when i go to buy something in the supermarket i take an eco box and it has the eco friendly things and if i use paper i must recycle it and i take it to the recycle shop also i wear old clothes and it is a good point
we enjoy cycling when we go out together we go cycling in nature somewhere i think it is a very important idea in many ways
i 'm really similar to my grandfather and my character resembles my grandfather 's too i 'm really grateful and honestly mine is the same as his character
i would like to live in tokyo because my grandparents lived there and i visit it more than twice a year every year and there people are grateful and the food is delicious and the city is always exciting
i think it is a good idea for schools and colleges to make time in the school day for all children to do fitness classes because the advantage of it is they can make their bodies strong and they do sport and they help themselves and each other and set the same goals as each other and the disadvantage of it is sometimes that causes injury to somebody in my opinion it is a good idea in many ways whatever they do i think it is good
first the bee collects nectar from flowers next the bee makes honey from nectar in beehives after the beekeeper collects honey from the beehives and the honey is packed in jars and transported by car and they 're arranged in the supermarket and they are sold at one point nine five euros for one
when i choose a country to study abroad i really feel it is important to consider safety because we have to study english safety is most important for us
studying in a second language is very important for us these days because we have to communicate with other countries ' people and we have to do business with the other countries ' people so we need to study
i feel the difficulty of studying in another country because i live in japan so i ca n't meet english people often so we have to meet them and speak english online only it is difficult
i am really interested in the local culture of other countries so when i go to another country i would like to go to the local places such as a shop and a restaurant and so on it is good for me
i think becoming independent is necessary for us to learn english because if we have japanese friends we could communicate in japanese so we have to be independent and learn
i enjoy my free time watching movies staying at home doing housework walking around going to the gym and eating healthy food
for me the best way to improve my english is to have someone to correct me and give me pieces of advice
the advantages are like they get or get to know how people behave in society and the disadvantages are that they need to do other things while they still need to study they need more time to study and my own opinion is that every single student needs to make an effort throughout his or her studies
so there are factories and vehicles that are located mainly in the city and they are very dramatic
the main advice that i can give them is to select the times that they need to eat at least they should eat five times per day choosing very good quality of food too
to drink a lot of water is so important for our health because so we need to oxygenate our body and at least we should drink like two litres
not every day but we need to do exercise at least three times per week for half an hour
sure sure we need to sleep eight hours per night and rest very well and have good dreams every night
it has a positive effect on our lives technology has a positive effect on our lives but is not the main thing that we need to live
i 'm really interested in learning about another country basically its culture and the beautiful places in this country i also want to learn about the customs habits and the way people live
sometimes i like to enjoy my free time listening to music and reading books
i watch english movies every day
so i want to cook more and more delicious food for him to enjoy and so i think i would learn cooking
nowadays all university students do part time jobs while they 're studying there are some advantages and some disadvantages however there are some disadvantages as you know many students they spend a lot of time doing part time jobs so they ca n't finish their courses many of them fail and so it 's very bad for their future when they ca n't get a degree in my opinion students should balance working doing a part time job and studying because studying is more important and they need to spend more time studying
acid rain is a very serious problem nowadays in many countries and they fly around some of them fall as dust but others still fly and they mix with cloud water and then there are many acid particles in rain and snow
they should try to avoid eating snacks and a lot of foods with lots of oil in and red meat is not good for their health they should eat more vegetables and fruits
drinking water is very important for our body it 's not good for your health they should drink clean water
i think that 's true i completely agree with the idea that people should sleep at least eight hours every night because sleeping is the time for us to relax and release stress also we need to have time to recharge our batteries after working very hard
on the roads technology changes our life there are lots of positive effects on our life but also it has some negative effects on our heath
it 's a very nice place where there are a lot of fishermen and it 's just by the sea it 's amazing
well when i 'm on holiday i usually like to visit places where i can you know learn about the countries about the culture about the people so i like you know to walk around and visit a lot and i also like to go to the beach and just wander around
i would say the advantages of having a job during your time at uni is that you are able to earn your own money get some life experience you know get to know different people i believe a disadvantage will be you know managing the time between your studies and the time for work that could be a problem but at the same time that could be a lesson as well you can learn from it so in my opinion i think it 's always a positive experience to get a job during your university time you can always learn something from it
in the first place to travel by airplane you need to get to an airport you can get there by car by bus or you can take the train airplanes get permission to take off and land from the control tower once you 're at the airport you have to look for the check in to check your tickets and to drop off your luggage from there you go to document control they will check your passport and then you 'll have security that will check your hand luggage then you can sit and wait to be called for boarding
well they can use technology through computers computers and the internet they can research everything they want online and they can use the computer to write everything they have documents
i think nowadays that 's been proven wrong we have a situation that we really understand now that if we do courses online they are as good as doing them face to face face to face is good but online is also possible
well they can learn how to listen to each other they can be more open minded they can learn how to discuss they can learn how to agree on things
i think it is i think when you see someone talking about a subject it 's more effective because you pay more attention than when you 're reading but with reading you can go back
it is very important nowadays students are used to a lot of technology and a lot of apps that do everything for them so if universities or schools do n't have what they have at home they will feel very disappointed
i 'm not very interested but i think that it 's quite important because we do n't have another planet to live on and the people are n't aware of the importance of the environment i think
well before the situation of covid nineteen we liked to play football but since this situation we like to play video games and read books
i think that is my mother because i have the same personality that she has and maybe my friends tell me that i have the same appearance that she has
well i think that one of the advantages is the fact that the students have to do some exercise to be healthy and so it 's so important i think that it is so important and the disadvantages i think that there are n't any i think you have to do your workout and be healthy
well the picture shows a diagram of how bees collect nectar from flowers and in the foreground i see a bottle with honey in it i see too a person with a jacket maybe because if he did n't wear it the bees would sting him and that 's it
the price of the things that they will be buying like a lot of food
i think that is quite important because it gives you an opportunity to travel around the world for example in my case i can travel with my english to birmingham london i think
i think that maybe the language because if you do n't know it it is quite difficult to learn it but if you speak the language i think that it will be easier
well i think that they have different ways one of them i think is talking with other people going out there and going shopping something like that
yeah absolutely i think that if you go far away from your home you have to be independent because if not you maybe can die if you do n't cook for yourself
well it 's really beautiful and we have nice views of mountains and the sea at night it 's windy so it 's nice to stay outside
yeah on holiday i enjoy staying at home and reading books but if the weather is fine i prefer going outside with my friends or family
i have to say that to be honest i enjoy spending my time with my sister because our age is similar and i am nineteen years old and she is twenty one years old we are like friends and i can tell her everything i 'm very comfortable with her
to be an english language teacher that is the aim that i really want to achieve and also i want to do some educational business not only in my country but also in foreign countries
i agree with that in my opinion the advantages of students getting jobs to pay for university studies are that they will be independent in the future and they will get work experience my opinion is it is really good to get a job but you must be flexible with your job and with your studies when it is time to work concentrate on your work when it 's time to study fully concentrate on your subject
ok first of all you have to travel to the airport by taking a bus or subway whatever transportation that you like you can take and then you have to pass through document control and also security and finally you have to wait
these days because of the pandemic we have to stay home it is the best time to make good use of technology you can study online and you can also download some educational apps and you can do some studying
yes i agree with that it is best to teach face to face it is more effective but these days unfortunately because of the pandemic we have to stay at home and study online so it is not very good for some people
and in the future they can work with a lot of people in a company or on something
that 's a good question what can i say for me i prefer reading alone because i can not concentrate well while i am attending lectures but some of my friends they prefer attending lectures it depends on the learner
yes it 's important to have learning facilities because you know most of the famous universities in the world have good facilities for students and then the students ' work it can be learned more effectively
i could n't agree more with environmentalists i am such a fan of greta thunberg and i also go to as many demonstrations as i can to show my support for this absolutely just cause
well it may sound odd but i do not have many friends i am devoted to my husband who is the person with whom i spend most of my free time just having nights in and watching the latest netflix movie makes me happy i do n't need anything else
well maybe it 's a cliche but my mother is my mirror she 's the person who has taught me all i know about love about life i love as she loves i am as sympathetic as she is
definitely my choice would be miami u s a where i had the opportunity to spend three months as an intern in the spanish consulate a time in which i fell in love with the city i am eager to go back
should fitness classes be mandatory for every student in schools and colleges what are the advantages of this kind of measure what are the disadvantages and finally what do i personally think well on weighing up the pros and cons i must say that i consider that these kinds of initiatives are quite useless no one can impose that on us it has to be our choice no one else 's
the production process of honey is a cycle that starts when those annoying little insects called bees collect nectar from flowers then the honey is bottled and transported to be put on our supermarket shelves for us to be able to enjoy
choosing a country that is english speaking is a must because going away has mainly an academic purpose and improving your english is essential for your future professional career
studying in a second language not only in english it is also valid to study in spanish portuguese or french will make the most of your brain and increase your i q to make you more intelligent
becoming independent is a natural consequence of moving away from your parents ' home it does n't matter if you choose to do it within the borders of your country or abroad the important point is that you take the decision to fly away
my spare time is mainly spent reading books and watching t v with my parents and other members of my family all together
obviously learn really really really fast as i think this could be really useful and really help me
i 'd like to say that for university students it 's better if they have some part time jobs as that could be really useful for their future and for their future professional degree or well for their professional career i think that could be an advantage but there are plenty of disadvantages for instance they ca n't focus on their own degree or their own studies for example so in my opinion i believe that it 's a double edged sword as they have to be really responsible
this drawing shows us the cycle of acid rain that damages the environment so also this acid rain could really really hurt and damage all of us people do nothing
it 's quite important as you might need to drink around two or three litres to be hydrated
i believe that every day no
i think that depends on if you do too much exercise in your day or not but it depends on you and what you think you should do
technology has always been incredible for us like the gadgets with for instance ipads
i am quite interested in it because it 's allowed me to enrich my knowledge about other people around the world and it can make me more sage in the future and it gives me an open mind
generally speaking i like going around with my friends going for a walk and so on and i also like to drink some beer or coffee while we are talking about our daily life or daily problems well it 's useful
well the best way to improve your english is practicing a lot and especially when you have the chance to speak a lot with other people so that you can check if you are understood you know and that 's quite important
i 've always wanted to know how to cook because it is very important it 's essential in life having notions about how to prepare your own meals so for me it would be vital for my life
well it 's a good thing that students do a part time job while they are a student because the benefit is that they can save money for their expenses such as food clothes travel the tickets for commuting and so on but in conclusion from my point of view it 's a perfect way to start to be financially independent from your parents also you have the chance to organise your time to combine work and studying so it 's a good way to become independent and mature
it is obvious that we must end the pollution in our cities this is because they are producing acid rain this is caused by the acid particles in smoke which is carried by the wind and some acid particles fall as dust and others mix with the clouds ' water that provokes those acid particles to fall down to the ground and that affects the growth of the plants and that affects the human population as well
well one of the pieces of advice would be to start eating fruits and vegetables as much as possible and avoid having products with a high amount of sugar that is the main point
yes at least thirty minutes of walking can help you have a better life
yes i think it 's true almost as much as you need because it 's a time when the body recovers from any illnesses or damage that it has had during the day so it 's quite important
depends on the device because if you have a heart attack there are devices that detect that problem easily so medical devices have improved a lot and it 's very important too
my town is small but it has a bridge river lake and mountain
i enjoy doing nothing
we like jogging and watching documentaries
i would like to work as a teacher
the disadvantage is they have less time to study less social time or to take a break
the first is travelling to the airport you can travel by taxi car bus or train when you arrive you will check in at your gate then you should pass the document control and security after you can wait sit in airport chairs go to a restaurant to the bathroom or go shopping when your airplane is ready you will board
they can use their p c for studying to take notes or to search on the internet
i do n't like to study face to face because i am shy
they can develop their patience and they learn how to deal with other people
if people need learning facilities they should have them
i have to admit that i am interested in the environment i 'm not really really really interested i 'm not really keen on the environment but anyway i try to read as many articles as possible every day on the news sites to be informed because i think this is an important matter in our modern lives
we enjoy doing different things together but one of the things that we probably do most is to go out for a beer and not a couple of beers just to have yeah interesting or normal conversation about some serious thing
i have n't given much thought to that but i 'd say that in the future i see myself in the some country in south america for example i 'd like to live in argentina at least for a few years
i think this is a good topic to talk about yeah thinking about the advantages i think one of the main advantages is that if we permit our students to do fitness classes yeah this is going to help them to develop a healthy lifestyle in the future about the disadvantages i 'd say one of the main disadvantages would be that they probably would have less time to work on other subjects so we have to take that into consideration my opinion i think from my point of view i 'd say that we should all schools should schedule some fitness lessons some fitness classes periodically
okay i 'm going to give a quick presentation about how honey yeah goes from flower to shop i think the first stage is that the bees collect nectar from flowers and then they will make honey from nectar in beehives after that the men who are beekeepers collect honey from the beehives and then this honey ends up on the shelves of the shops
yeah i think students should consider many aspects many things for example what language is spoken in that country even if the country is too far from the home country because sometimes you want to get a flight and it can be very very expensive
when you study in a second language the main thing the main advantage is that you are going to learn the other language
so try to go out as much as possible
yeah i totally agree with the people who think that because i think when you are alone in other countries and you have to face so many difficulties every single day it 's going to help you to become more independent yeah this is certain
i live in seville and seville is the best city in the world it has a lot of cultural sites for example the cathedral of seville and the giralda it 's amazing and the food is good
on holidays i used to go to the beach with my family but right now i am working in a swimming pool so i will not go with my family this year but i will go with my boyfriend on weekends
well in the future i will be a government employee i mean i would like to have a government job and help people that need help at least financial help
well to have a part time job at the same time that you are studying at university could be really hard the advantages are that you could save money to spend on a good master 's when you finish your degree and you know what your limits are and the disadvantages are that you do n't have enough free time to spend with your family or your friends to go out go to the cinema or go to the beach in my opinion this is really enriching because you learn how to organise yourself you need to know how much time you will spend studying and how much time you will be working
well travelling by plane could be complicated but it is easier than you think first of all you must n't forget your passport and your documentation first you go by car taxi or bus to go to the airport once you are there you will do your check in with a person that will help you then you should wait a while and you can go to the bathroom or have a coffee then you will board and that is all
well nowadays every company has new technology and people have to adapt to globalisation so this year technology has been really important because of covid
well in the future students probably will need to work in groups so you will need to be good at teamworking in my opinion it is a great idea
that is how you will do your exam
in my opinion this is really really important for public schools and universities because if they do n't have resources the government should provide them
personally i 'm very interested in the environment because there 's no planet b so we have to take great care of this because in the future our children are going to live on the earth and we have to keep it as best we can together
i met most of my friends in the travel agency where i used to work so the thing that we really enjoy the most is travelling all together especially to mexico because we love the beaches over there and all the food and the traditions
i would say that i 'm very close to my mum because she 's the one who spends the most time with me and we are also creating a business together so we do really enjoy doing the same things like for example developing this hand made jewellery brand
two years ago i had the opportunity to study abroad in the u s and there i discovered miami so i would say that miami it 's my kind of place where there 's always good weather and many things to do so definitely i would love to live there in the future
when talking about introducing fitness classes in schools i would say that there are more advantages than disadvantages to it because it is undeniable that getting students to do exercises at least thirty minutes a day it helps them to be in better shape and to be healthier in the future so i would say that these are the main advantages on the other hand the disadvantage it 's that it will take a lot of time for the students to get ready for it and then shower after doing those fitness classes
so today we are going to go through the whole process of how honey goes from a flower to the shop so firstly the bees collect the nectar from the flowers especially during the spring they make honey from the nectar in their beehives which are their homes so once the beekeepers who are watching those beehives see that there 's a bunch of honey they collect it and they send it to the manufacturing companies who actually put it into individual jars and after that those companies are the ones that transport it and sell it to the stores where we are able to get it when we go to the supermarkets
based on my personal experience a candidate that is trying to choose a country to study in the first thing that they have to take into account is the language because otherwise it is going to be very difficult for them to follow all the classes and to be integrated in the classroom
so the benefits of studying in a second language they are very clear because you get to know more people and you are able to travel by yourself to more countries where you are going to have more possibilities to express yourself to other people
i think that there are many barriers that you could face when studying in another country for instance not only the language itself because you can learn that but the traditions and the culture there at the very beginning can be very shocking for a foreign student
when you are abroad you have to really learn about the local culture by hanging out with locals if you just keep hanging out with the international people you are not going to be immersed in it and it is not going to be as beneficial as possible
personally i totally agree with that statement because for many people when you study abroad it is your first time being independent without your parents and you learn how to actually manage all your finances your house and everything doing the groceries and everything
i 'm from cadiz but i live in granada because i 'm studying there granada is a fantastic city but the only problem is it has n't got a beach
on holiday i love to go to the beach go out with my friends go to parties with my friends visit my friends from other cities
he is three years older than me and i like doing sport with him
i am studying psychology and in the future i would like to be a neuropsychologist because i like the different neuropathologies
an advantage is that you can be more responsible and the disadvantage is time it 's more difficult to work and study but in my opinion all students should work and study at the same time in the last year of their degree
when you are travelling by plane the first thing is to travel to the airport you can travel by car by bus or by train when you arrive at the airport the first thing that you have to do is the check in and then you have to go and show your documents at document control and pass the security control then after that you can wait have a coffee go to the shops go to the toilet at the boarding time of your plane you board the plane and then your flight starts
i do n't agree with this because for example there are a lot of degrees and master 's online and in my opinion i think that they are a good option to study
for working in group projects i think that organistion is important it 's important to listen to your partners
the place where i live is a three storey building with a small garden in front of it there is a small parking area behind the place
actually i do a lot of activities on holiday i usually spend some quality time with my friends and family i occasionally visit some places which are in my city and i seldom play cricket and volleyball with my friends
undoubtedly my brother he is my elder brother and he is quite funny and sometimes we spend a lot of time together we enjoy dinner together we enjoy talking and sharing some information with each other and i usually play cricket with him a lot
so in the future i want to be a computer engineer well i have completed my bachelor 's now so i want to be a good programmer i guess in the future and it is very helpful for me to build my career
to begin with if students do a job while studying at university they will be very independent from their parents so it is very advantageous for them apart from that also they acquire and widen their knowledge in different fields well there are also several disadvantages to doing a part time job during their university studies first of all they can not keep up with their studies because they find maybe difficulties with their course and it might be getting hard in the exam situation so there may be some times when students may fail but in my opinion it is quite advantageous for students if they become independent and do a job while they 're studying
now i 'm gon na talk about how to travel by plane and all the processes you are required to go through at airports first of all you have to travel by car taxi or bus or train to the airport after that you have to provide your passport and some documents so that the airport authority will verify your identity and then you have to pass through the security process and then wait for your flight so when the plane has arrived you will be notified by the airport authority and then you have to find your seat on the airplane according to your ticket and then the plane will take off from the you know airport
students nowadays use technology in various ways apart from that they can you know gather information from various sources through the internet it will be very helpful for them in their studies
from my perspective face to face studying is quite beneficial for students as a teacher can notice the behaviour of a student and they can find some mistake of a student and also give some wise advice on how to correct that mistake
there are various skills students can improve by studying and working in a group the skill of communication develops while working in a group
from my perspective attending lectures is more interesting than reading alone whenever you read alone you can you know find it boring but in contrast whenever you attend a lecture you can interact with your peers as well as your teacher so it may be beneficial
and so that student can learn more and they can get a better job in the future
well the place where i live is a small city in the south east of spain what i most like is that people are very friendly and there is a very good environment in the streets
due to my work i do n't have a lot of holidays but in any case what i most like doing is travelling abroad with my family in order to improve my knowledge about other cultures and customs
the person who i most enjoy spending my time with is my son because he is so lovely
in the future i would like to continue working as a teacher at the university because i really love this job
on the one hand if you work while you are studying you have the opportunity to earn money for travel and doing other things apart from being focused on your studies on the other hand as you spend time working you have less time for studying perhaps your academic results could be less satisfactory than you expect
the first step is to travel to the airport in your own car or by public transport once you are in the airport you have to go to the check in desk and present your identification and leave your baggage there after obtaining your boarding card you have to pass the security control but before you have to show your identification once you have done the security step you can wait in the restaurants and after that you can board and take off
working in group projects you can develop mainly skills related with collaboration self confidence organisation of work
they must provide facilities in order to be up to date
well i live in madrid it is a really huge city it is known because of its large population of chinese people so it 's like the chinatown of madrid so we have a very multicultural neighborhood
well i really like to relax and to not think about my work or study or anything so i really like to watch series and t v shows just hanging out with my friends going to the swimming pool or even to the beach if i can read books and just have time for myself spend time by myself
i like spending time with my sister because she is like four years older than me and we look alike we 're very similar in personality and in hobbies so i really like spending time with her speaking about anything that happens in our daily lives because she does n't live with me anymore
well i 'm preparing to be a scientist so i would really like to do science and i am looking for a p h d position in something related to neuroscience and i would really like to research and just find something that could help people with neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimer 's
i think the good thing about working while you are studying in university is that you can earn your own money so it makes you realise how important and difficult it is to get your own money and support yourself i also think that helps you develop skills like social skills and working under pressure although i think that it is right it 's actually really complicated to work while you are studying possibly or probably your marks are going to go down you are not going to get as good marks as you might be able to and you will have to spend less time meeting your friends and doing stuff you like in my personal opinion no one should be obligated to do it only if you want to do it i think the government should pay the tuition fees
the first thing you have to do is get to the airport you can do it using different forms of transport you can go by car by bus or by train there are different things and also you can take a taxi or any other private transport once you get there you will have to check in you will have to show your ticket and your identification card and go to document control depending on the place you 're gon na go you may even need to do it twice afterwards you have to go through security afterwards you have to wait until you can get on the plane and you will board you will sit in the plane and you 're just ready to enjoy your flight
there are different ways to use technology in order to study better for example you can watch many youtube videos that help you out a lot for example with mathematics i think you can use it for different resources in my case for example i 'm a biologist and i really need to read papers and the internet is a way to do it
i absolutely agree with this idea i think that teachers are really important so it really helps you learn i do n't know
yeah i think so and there is a lot of information you get and it 's sometimes easier to understand stuff if someone explains it to you verbally and you 're not just reading
it is really important nowadays teachers use slides to explain stuff you also need laptops and your university should give you laptops if you do n't have your own laptop and your library should be modern enough you have to have your catalog on the internet
there is a lot of forest and parks with lagoons and i really like all the nature there is around me and it 's a beautiful place
and that 's my life
not only my mum but also my sister she is everything to me so i really love her and my sister too
i really would like to be an animator in disney or dreamworks i have a lot of possibilities in the arts
that way we can graduate but we really need to understand that one of the disadvantages is the accumulation of topics subjects and assignments when we are working so please focus on what is more important so you can get a job and pay for your university studies later
later you need to go to the station and you need to check in on the web page when it 's time for you to board the plane you need to board and the plane takes off
students use technology principally to focus on and investigate some topics some new topics languages watch videos about something and write and do their homework
the subjects could be ethics a lot of law arts in this case they can improve their abilities about art communication and give out some scores and feedback about something
all depends on the student some would be better with reading alone for others it 's better attending lectures but it all depends on the students and their best way to study
what i mean is this twenty first century is the age of technology
the place where i live is a little town next to the sea on the costa brava it 's a little village and it 's so cool to live there because there are n't so many people and it 's very quiet
the thing that i most enjoy when i 'm on holiday is going to the beach and swimming in the sea and hanging out with my friends sleeping until very late and basically doing nothing
i could n't choose between my mother and my father i love them both and i enjoy my time with both of them
in the future i will be a teacher and i am studying at university to achieve my dream
the advantages are that you will gain experience and also money but there are a lot of disadvantages for example in my case i could n't work and study at the same time because university takes all my time i have a lot of work a lot to study and it 's impossible for me to work and also there 's a lot of people like me that ca n't combine study and work my opinion is this if you study you study and if you work you work but the two things together are a little messy
this is a summary of how to travel by airplane first you have to go to the airport you can use a car bus a train or a taxi once you 're there you have to go to the terminal and after that you have to go to the check in they will check your luggage after that you have to show your i d identification and after that you go to security they will check that your bag is safe and then when you pass the security you will have to wait until it 's time to board the plane and when you board the plane then you can go
we can use technology in some different ways with computers and tablets we have a lot of information and we can use the internet to do all the work in all the studies that we need
in my opinion i prefer to attend a face to face class because i think i can focus more on what the teacher is saying and i can take better notes
working on group projects is a good way to work because it has a lot of benefits for everyone in the group we learn to split the task we learn to work together and cooperate and i think it 's very useful
well i think that attending lectures is worse than reading on your own because you are not as focused as when you are reading and that 's why i think it 's better to read on your own
for universities learning facilities are a basic thing they have to provide good learning facilities for the students so they can do their degrees effectively
i like playing the trumpet with my father or with the band on friday on sunday i like staying at home with my family
i think the best way is to go abroad to england for example but it 's very difficult for me because i do n't have enough money so i think the best option is to study in an english academy
so i think i could work on that
on the one hand you can earn money if you work ca n't you and you can help your parents because they are the ones who pay for all your studies are n't they on the other hand it 's very difficult studying and working at the same time this interferes with your studies it 's difficult to pass with a high mark in all cases
and some of them fall down to the forests and lakes and the sea other particles mix with the water and when it 's raining or snowing these particles fall down to the earth
i recommend other people to eat healthy food for example vegetables salad because fast food is bad for us
it is very important because our body needs this water all food has water in it and the experts recommend us to drink one litre a day
in my opinion it is very important
i think it is positive for example social networks can show different healthy habits eh
i live in a small town that is surrounded by nature and you have many hiking routes to do in the town
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy haging out with friends also spending time with my family who are not near to me during the whole year and i also like to travel to and discover new places that i do n't know
i really enjoy spending time with my sister because she does n't live with me and i really like being with her and spending quality time with her because she 's a very important person in my life and i really love to have time with her
i would like to be a hotel manager but i do n't know if it is going to be possible but i am going to work in a tourist company because this is what i studied and it is the thing that i want to work in
in my opinion students have to work to pay for their university studies if their families do n't have enough resources to meet that cost but i think if they have the support the financial support of their families they should not work because i think that the advantage of working to pay for your studies is that you have financial independence and you do n't have to depend on your parents but it is going to take you a lot of time when you must be studying or a lot of rest time which you need to have energy and to improve and to have good results in your studies in your university studies
so this graph shows us the different steps that you have to follow to travel by airplane as we can see the first step is that you have to travel to the airport you can do it by car by train or by bus then you have to do the check in with your travel company and this is the first step then the next step is that you have to pass the document control with the police and then you have to pass the security control where they are going to check your luggage then you have to wait before the boarding time in the airport you have many things to do like shopping have a coffee have lunch and then you can board the plane
i think that the students search on the internet for many different articles that can help them to improve their learning
i think that learning face to face with a teacher is the best way to learn because you have the person in front of you to ask her or him all the questions that you have and they can help you with your issues
for me it works better to read alone because i prefer to be by myself with my thoughts i prefer this way of reading to attending a series of lectures where they can distract you i do n't know for me it 's better to read alone
and i think that is very helpful
the place where i live is quiet and there 's not a lot of people so you can sleep well here there is a lot of nature it 's a village it 's not a city so that 's it
when i 'm on holiday i love to go to the swimming pool and swim and be with my friends there if it 's raining i like to do other things like stay at home watching netflix watching series
i like to spend time with my brother my brother is one year older than me so we 're good friends we spend all the time together we do a lot of things like we go running we go swimming and we go climbing
so i would train them i guess
if students worked to pay their studies they would be more independent from their parents and also they would be more prepared for real life because things have to be paid off and the disadvantages i would say the time for studying is less so they might have worse marks in their degree so my opinion is that parents should support their children to pay for their studies because everyone not everyone but the majority of people want to study and have a future you know so i would say no
okay to travel by airplane we need tickets they 're very important and a taxi or car or some friend who can take us to the airport and legal documents such as our i d or passport okay we will travel to the airport first and then when we 're in the airport we go to the check in they will check all our documents our tickets then they call us to board and then the plane will take off with us
i think it 's not maybe if you go to a lecture and you do n't understand what 's being explained and you are not motivated it 's more useful to read and understand by yourself
it is very important to have good facilities such as a computer a fast computer but definitely it 's not the most important thing for students i would say the most important thing is how they teach and not what they use to teach you know
i am very interested
when i have free time i go to the kitchen to make a sandwich or i watch t v or watch videos or watch tiktok
i practice my english with an app talking with foreigners
i want to be more flexible
the advantage that they can have is to learn more about the subject and do a good job the disadvantage may be that they work at some things that they have already done
second acid particles are in smoke third acid particles are carried by the wind fourth some acid particles fall as dust fifth other acid particles mix with cloud water and sixth acid particles are in rain or snow
when we drink water our skin is very very beautiful and our health is so important
it 's very important to sleep eight hours every night because our body will be very tired
i am very interested because i am a biologist i studied animals plants all things that are related to the environment
i usually go to a bar or to a restaurant at the weekend
probably i think my mother because her character is like mine she is a shy person but works a lot
i want to live in madrid because it 's a big city and you have a lot of possibilities to work in my field that is science
i think that the best or the worst disadvantage is that you have less time to study other subjects like science that i think is very important today
okay honey prodution starts with the bees obviously because the bees collect nectar from flowers then the next step is when the bees make honey from nectar in beehives it 's an easy cycle to understand because all of us know how bees make honey it 's a simple cycle
i think the cost of living if the cost is very high you probably would n't go to this place and the proximity to your home country and other things
if you know another language you can go to other countries you can speak with people from other cultures and it 's good for your curriculum vitae because you could probably obtain better work in the future
i think that the biggest difficulty is the culture because if you go to another country you will find different situations in your life like if you want to take the bus it 's different
i think that it is necessary to go out to a bar to a restaurant to a supermarket to a library to a museum speaking with the people of this country could help you learn about this culture
of course because you need for example to open a bank account
my favourite time of the year is springtime because everything is blooming the flowers are very nice i think nature is awake the birds are chirping and yeah i think everything is very very wonderful outside marvelous
it is pretty important i think if you would like to be well informed about the world
oh good question i do n't really know i 'd like to buy a detached house and move there together with my family it would be a good idea i think because i am a mother of two and for my children a garden would be great i guess but it is not feasible at the moment and i 'd like to teach english later
as for me i would say that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience because there would be so many benefits beneficial effects of it and i think it would be a good idea for the future employer and for him or her as an employee the disadvantage is maybe if the student knows about the work in a more detailed way it would dissuade him or her from doing that kind of job later but all in all i would say that it would be a really brilliant idea to be on one of these courses
in this chart i can see the number of people who are interested in online pop music sites the red line shows a kind of upward trend for those listeners who will listen to tunes net and as far as songs four you is concerned we can see a downward tendency because the number of listeners basically drops significantly and as far as the music now site is concerned there is a kind of stagnating phenomenon because basically the number of people who listen to this channel basically stagnates
well this is an interesting question i think a good team leader should be ambitious should have expertise in the field where he or she works in my opinion he or she should be a good collaborative worker
this is a brilliant question maybe the problem can be that there is too much work for each member and they can feel stressed after a tiring working day it must be very difficult to divide the tasks equally
i do n't think so in my opinion for that collaboration and agreement is highly recommended definitely needed
this is a pretty good question in my opinion it can depend on the situation the type of work the type of company where the employees are employed so it depends but sometimes a face to face situation is definitely needed it depends on the type of the problem
teams can function better than working alone however it depends on the type of people who are in the team
but while it 's a good city to spend time in in summer it 's so so hot
i like to spend my free time with my mates in pubs or in my friends ' houses for example i used to play computer games for example i would like to have more time
if you ask me i would select my sister because she 's of a similar age to me so we have the same interests and we have good communication too so i would select my sister
while on the other hand the main disadvantage is the time that they must spend spending time studying is a problem because in general terms they have n't a lot of time
okay regarding the question you must follow these instructions first obviously you must travel to the airport in a personal car bus train or something similar ok there 're other possibilities at this point in the airport you must check in and the assistant will help you also you must speak with the security personnel and document control personnel and well at this point after all this you must wait which is frustrating but you will have to do it anyway so finally you can board the plane before the plane takes off from the ground and well have a good trip where to
technology is without doubt a revolution in the way we study also technology is dangerous and it 's one of the distractions for students
given the choice i would probably select books
regarding the question no in my opinion attending lectures is n't a better option than reading alone
i 'm not really interested in learning about other countries although i think it could be interesting
i enjoy spending my free time playing video games with my friends or listening to some music
the best way for me to improve my english is by watching netflix films or series
if i could learn to do something new i would like to learn to cook because i really like eating
one of the advantages that you can have by doing a part time job while studying is that you can start earning some money and one of the disadvantages it has is that you can get distracted from doing other things other important things and my opinion is that although you can get distracted from school and important things it is a good thing since you are experimenting with new things in your life
acid rain is formed when vehicles and factories produce pollution which consists of acid particles in smoke which are carried by the wind and some of them fall as dust while others mix with cloud water and then fall in the form of rain or snow damaging the environment with acid rain
they should think about which nutrients are the best for their body and can keep them in shape
it is important for conserving energy and maintaining the body hydrated
i think it 's not an essential thing as long as you have good eating habits and you drink a lot of water
well it has been proved that this is the optimum length of time for us to rest and sleep so i think people should have a really controlled sleep schedule
i think it has had a bad impact on people since they have stopped paying attention to a lot of important things and they just look at social media
it 's a very peaceful and quiet place and all the people know each other and are family or friends
when i am on holidays i love to swim in the sea and play volleyball on the beach with my friends yes
i always dreamed of working in the future as a social educator yes because i love to help people
well let 's have a look okay one of the advantages of this is that the students could study at university and another advantage is that yes if the students study at university they will get a good job in the future well one of the disadvantages is the students will have less time to study and they maybe wo n't be able to hang out with their friends in my opinion university might be cheaper
well first obviously you must go to the airport you can go by bus by train or in your car ok when you arrive at the airport you must go to the check in and the security control after that you must wait around two hours more or less for the plane and you can wait in the restaurant and you can go to the w c or cafe or shopping then you board the plane and finally you relax and travel
students can maybe use the technology to study because there are some websites with a lot of information about different topics and students might find these interesting
in my opinion learning face to face with a teacher is a good way to learn
depends reading alone is so good for learning about a topic but attending lectures is another good way to learn about it
it 's very important that the university gives to the students facilities like internet books dictionaries et cetera
i 'm interested in ensuring my environment is clean and the temperature is comfortable and that 's all
what i like to do with my friend is go to karaoke
my mother is very similar to me
so the advantage is that all students ' health improves because they are in this society and a lot of students do n't move their body but the disadvantage is if they have a handicap and they ca n't join the classes so they have bad things bad fears so my opinion is the college should have the fitness classes because their health will improve
so i will explain how to make honey so the six steps to make the honey so from flower to shop the first one bees collect nectar from flowers and the second step bees make honey from nectar in beehives and the next step beekeepers collect honey from beehives and the honey is moved to the shop and sold
so the advantage of studying in a second language is they can talk to a lot of people in other countries
the first step is before they move to another country they have to search on the web
they become independent in another country because they have to do things for themselves the cleaning and the cooking and the speaking
i am interested in learning about different countries because it is significant for me it 's very interesting for me
as i work a lot when i have free time i try and have a rest i am fond of outdoor activities such as biking riding bicycles having fun walking
as for me the best way to improve my english is speaking constantly writing different essays reading various books and listening to various podcasts
i am interested in different literature and i like to do a variety of research
i think yes all university students should do part time jobs because there are a lot of advantages to it they can earn their own money and they can spend it only on what they want
i think there are a lot of problems connected with factories and vehicles because factories produce a lot of harmful emissions also all vehicles produce a lot of carbon dioxide emissions so as a result we get pollution in our ecosystem so acid particles are in smoke and we can smell this pollution and acid particles are carried by wind some acid particles will fall as dust other acid particles mix with cloud water and acid particles are in rain or snow so we are forced to smell this pollution
i think it is important for every person to drink enough water during the day because we lose our water balance and we must fill ourselves up with water
of course i think it is necessary for people to start every day with morning exercises it is not necessary to go to the gym to do some exercise but it 's enough to do stretches and exercises
it depends on how you look at it of course there are advantages of using technologies in our life because various apps related with our health and exercises can help you to keep a healthy lifestyle
i am really interested in the environment because i am studying marine environment organisms and also i 'm conscious of the problems of global warming
i have a lot of friends and i enjoy practising some water sports with them
we have a lot of characteristics in common and we are patient
i would like to live in menorca in the future because i think it 's a great place to have a child and also i have my family on that island
so nowadays almost all the colleges and schools dedicate part of their time to fitness classes and the consequence is some advantages and disadvantages the first advantage of doing fitness classes is that the students can learn how to practice or do some sport at home also the disadvantage of doing fitness classes is that some students do n't or ca n't follow the rules and do n't take these classes seriously and then it is a waste of time for these kinds of students in my opinion it 's a great idea
so i 'm gon na talk about an interesting process in which bees make honey and then we find it in the supermarkets bees collect nectar from flowers and it depends on the kind of flower that bees are looking for the pollen in it could be one or another kind of honey there 're monofloral honeys and those based on multifloral components the bees transport the nectar to beehives and then they store it and the honey inside it is the work of beekeepers to collect honey from the beehives and they have to take some precautions because the bees are dangerous insects
so i think that learning a second language is very beneficial in terms of cultural richness and also to earn more money it 's a great skill and could open a lot of doors in your work
so learning a new language is very time consuming and sometimes there are some cultural problems but i think that if you have a good attitude you can learn properly and will be a better person
the easiest way for students to get to know the culture of a foreign country is by making local friends or speaking with natives they are the ones who can best teach them about their culture
so generally it is i am a student abroad and i have to say that i 'm more independent and i 've learnt a lot of things that i could n't have learnt if i 'd just stayed at home so i totally agree
definitely my mother i like her i look like her and my personality is the same as her personality and i love her so much
young people need to do a lot of exercise so there are many benefits to doing fitness classes at school or college because they can grow up healthy and active and there are some drawbacks we can mention because they can hurt themselves and sometimes maybe they can feel bad
well firstly bees collect nectar from flowers and transport this nectar to their beehives where they make honey from nectar then beekeepers with special equipment to avoid bee stings collect the honey from the beehives and after that they bottle their honey the last step is they transport their honey to the supermarkets to be sold
i mean it will be near their country so they can go back frequently
if you have the chance to travel abroad you can communicate with other people if you have a second language for example english english is used around the world so it 's really useful
if they do n't know the language well maybe they can find it difficult to communicate if they have to go to the doctor or do any documents
it 's essential to know about the local culture if you are living abroad so you know what their way of life is there
the situation helps them to live independently without their parents
i reckon i 'm most similar to my mother we think the same way and also people say that i look like her physically so yeah i look similar to her
well i like many countries including spain but i think if i had to choose one i would go to italy because it 's a country that i have always thought like it 's the best country
well there are many advantages for example they can relax if they are very stressed because of their studies i do n't think that it has disadvantages but well if i have to say one i will say that students can become obsessed with sport we know that when they are teenagers they do n't feel so comfortable with their bodies so it could be dangerous if they become obsessed in my opinion sport is an essential activity for staying healthy so young people should practice it very often
we usually buy honey in shops but have you ever thought how it is produced well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and with this nectar bees make honey in their beehives then the beekeepers take the honey from the beehives and the next step is to put the honey in a container so it can be distributed in shops and finally the honey is in stores so people can buy it
i think that i wo n't have any doubts choosing a country it will be italy since i was little i have always wanted to go there i do n't know why but i will choose it yeah
i think that it helps us to travel around the world we can communicate with other people also we can find a job more quickly if we know how to speak another language
i believe that at first the most difficult thing is to get on with people however over time you find it easy
i think that the easiest way to learn about the culture is travelling around the local places so you can find many cultural landmarks
yes i totally agree because you are alone when you go abroad to study
so i live apart from where i 'm originally from so on my holiday i go back to my home to spend time with my family especially with my brother i play a video game just like once a year it 's like a competition and it is really fun
i said this in a previous question it 's going to be my little brother this is because i play a video game with him and you know we play the same sport baseball so we play catch together and spending a lot of the time with him is really always fun
i would like to have the job of an airline pilot this is because it was just my childhood dream since i was very little and also this is sometimes my current dream too so i think that 's what i want to be
i think that there are lots of pros and cons to getting a job to pay for your university studies one of the advantages is that you can get work experience to explore what you are interested in and also try to figure out what you need in the future like specific skills and anything that you can learn but the disadvantage will be that your focus will be on the job not your studies and in my opinion you should do a part time job however you should mainly focus on your studies at university and in that way you can explore your interests
so nowadays a lot of people travel a lot so i will give a presentation about how to travel by airplane we have three steps after you get to the airport until you board the airplane so once you get to the airport you have to check in yeah you have to check in your luggage and also give the clerk your identification and ticket and then you go through the document control and in the document control you have to show your passport and identification to check you are the right person to get in and also the final security and then you board
i think the best thing about technology for studying is that you do n't have to carry a lot of textbooks and notes i think if you 've got an ipad or something like that you can take notes on that and also you can see the textbook on that
yeah i think learning like face to face is great but this is because i can show the teacher the part that i do n't get and the teacher can focus on just teaching that to me
this is because like the students will explain to each other about what you got and in that way the knowledge just stays in your mind
yes i think so too this is because you can understand what the teacher 's just focused on by his or her tone of voice and also the pace of speaking so yeah
really that is a good question
a lot of things when i am with my friends we usually go on a journey to the mountains take photos and mainly stay together
if i have to choose one i 'll choose my uncle because he loves photography and i love photography too and we speak a lot about that
if i could choose i would live with my brother in panama city because it 's a big city and a wonderful city and i love it
as i see it the main advantage of doing fitness classes at schools and colleges it 's the health of their students regarding the disadvantages i reckon that they are less than the advantages the main disadvantage in my opinion it 's the students ' tiredness i mean if they arrive tired for other classes their performance will go down as far as i 'm concerned the fact of doing any kind of exercise at school and college is good for the students and for the profession in general
honey from flower to shop the first part of the process is bees collecting nectar from flowers later bees make honey from the nectar in beehives and the beekeepers collect this honey in jars or glass bottles
let 's see at first i think it 's a disadvantage because you ca n't understand anything but over time you can understand a lot
when you 're a student in another country you can go to local places local clubs or do a lot of things to learn about this culture
i agree with this statement because in my case i live with my parents and i do n't know what living alone like independently is like and it 's a disadvantage
i can get to the beach in only ten minutes on foot
i enjoy going surfing i often go surfing because my house is very close to the beach
i want to be a pilot so i can go anywhere all around the world
i think there are two advantages for students first they can acquire new skills second they can manage their money themselves on the other hand they spend less time studying this is a disadvantage for students i think students should not get jobs to pay for their university studies because it is important for students to study
i will give you a presentation about traveling by airplane first travel to the airport you can get a taxi or train or buses to the airport you pass all these sections you have to wait ten minutes you can go to a cafe you can buy something there you can get on the plane
i think so too because it is important when studying something to ask some questions so it is important
they can acquire communications skills and can achieve a common goal together
i think so because if we attend lectures the teacher can give us the main points to study
ok i enjoy a lot of things when i am with my friends like going to parties together watching series or movies in english or spanish listening to music together in spanish or in english so i love spending time with my friends
i think that is my mum because my mother has the same qualities as me and i love my mother
i want to live to germany because one part of my family lives in this country and i love its culture its customs its people the life in this country and i love germany and i want to live in this country
hi everyone today i 'm going to talk about whether schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all the students to do fitness classes i think that this topic is so very important because this has a lot of advantages for example all the students increase their happiness improve their lifestyle and maybe improve a lot of things the principal improvement is their positive attitude an improvement in their mental health their healthy lifestyle i think that it is something that does n't have a disadvantage maybe i think that it 's not very stressful for the students and in my opinion it 's so very important that all the students do the fitness classes every day and i think that it 's very important that the schools offer these fitness classes i think they are very important
hi everyone today i 'm going to talk about how honey is produced so the first step is the bees collect nectar from flowers so the second step is the bees make honey from nectar in beehives and the next step is the beekeepers collect honey from beehives i think that is very important
obviously it 's very difficult studying in another country because you are away from your family
yes i think if you have the opportunity to study in another country you become independent and i think that is very useful in your life
when i do n't have any obligations i 'm keen on watching series and films and also listening to music as i think it helps me to relax and another hobby that i have is cooking which i think i 'm really good at
actually with my mum as we have lots of things in common we are both adventurous we like to visit new places and also we love to train and do exercise so we have a really good time when we are together and i love her
as i 'm into ballet i hope i can spend the rest of my life practicing it so i hope i can join a company and become a professional dancer
in my opinion it is great for students to take jobs as their parents wo n't have to pay for everything and it will be easier and cheaper for them also students can gain work experience and they will be more qualified when they finish college but the disadvantages are that they wo n't have much time left to study and that 's why they will have to be really well organised in order to be able to do both activities studying and working also this could be really really tiring in my opinion this would be an awesome experience for students and really helpful for their parents so it 's a really good option
hi everyone today i will explain all the things you need to do to travel by airplane first of all as you see in the first picture you need to travel to the airport and you can choose any means of transport you want for example you can go by car by bus or by train then after you arrive there you 'll need to do the check in where your documents will be controlled there 's also a security control where the luggage you 'll take with you on the plane will be checked then you will be free to wait in an area where you can buy presents eat something or you can go to the bathroom then you 'll finally be able to board your plane and after all those steps your flight will take off
but it has a lot of advantages for example students can write long documents or reports faster and in an easy way also they 'll be able to save them all in the same place and in addition they can search for any information they need on the internet and do investigations
in my opinion times are changing and there are a lot of people that have started learning virtually so it has been proved that both methods have their own advantages and it 'll depend on each student which one to choose maybe depending on their likes and preferences
but also they learn to pay attention to everyone and discuss different topics by expressing their own thoughts and defending their ideas
definitely as i think that teachers can explain any subject in a more interesting and easy way
i think many tourists come here
i often enjoy baking sweets for example chiffon cake and i feel happy when my family eat it and tell me it is delicious
my little sister enjoys playing catch ball with me because she and i like baseball very much
i think the advantages of all students getting jobs to pay for their university studies is students can get working skills in advance i think it will be useful in their future and that the disadvantage of this is that students can not concentrate on their studies so i think the disadvantage outweighs the advantage
i 'll explain what you need to do to travel by airplane firstly you have to go to the airport by car or train or something and next you have to pass the document control and security and if you go abroad you need to show a passport and once the check is finished you wait
by studying together students can get communication skills so they can cooperate with other team members i think it will be useful in their future so it is very important in education
learning facilities are very important things because if students have good learning facilities they can concentrate on their studies more
i am very interested in the environment because i think nowadays we have a pandemic with the contamination and it 's necessary to save the planet for this reason i follow a vegan diet rich in plant protein
it 's a difficult question because we go to different places but usually we go to the beach and prepare a little picnic with junk food and we talk about our life
i think i 'm most similar to my little brother because we love the same activities we watch the same movies science fiction these days
in the future i would really like to live in the same place where i live at this moment because i really love my island and i love to wake up in the morning and see the ocean
on the one hand i think it 's a good initiative for schools because nowadays obesity is a global pandemic in the world usually in kids on the other hand i think it 's not a good idea because i think everybody should decide for themselves it 's a personal decision to practice or not practise sport in my opinion it 's a difficult question for me because i do n't know i think it 's good but i disagree with the idea
first bees collect nectar from the different flowers then these bees make honey from nectar in beehives some time later beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives and put the honey in different bottles
the advantage of studying in a second language is of course if you 're learning and you practice and practice and practice this language when you finish your studies you are an expert in this language
firstly i think the most difficult thing is the language of course it depends on the place but i think it 's the language and then i think for example the weather you go to for example poland the weather in gran canaria and poland is completely different
i think a student learns a lot about culture the places the typical places for example theatres museums and so on but i think the most important is the food because food is an important part of the culture in every place
i think it 's true because last year i went on the erasmus scheme and when i got back home i had become independent from my family because one year in another country you change completely so i agree
my favourite time of year i think is my birthday i really like this day the twenty ninth of october because i used to celebrate my birthday with all my family and my boyfriend
to me it 's really important because i really want to be aware of what is happening in the world so i used to read the newspaper every day i mean every morning
i used to spend my time with my sister playing games
i hope to be working in a fashion company in human resources because it 's been my dream since i was a child and if it 's not possible i would like to work as a buyer because i really like the fashion world
i think a period of practical work experience is the best way to find out what you want to do in the future in my case for example i did n't know if i wanted to be a lawyer or if i wanted to be in human resources so i started my internship in a company and it was fantastic it was the best experience for me however one of the disadvantages was that i needed to go to the company to be in the practice but i needed to go to the university as well to go class so this was the worst experience
so as we can see in the graphic tunes net started very badly and now is one of the three most listened to online pop music sites so it was great for tunes net however songs four you started not too badly but now is a less listened to site and music now started well started not badly increased a lot but now is decreasing so tunes net is the best one because it started very badly and now is increasing and increasing a lot
to be a good team leader the person needs to be very serious needs to be very sensible and needs to be good very good under pressure
the problem i think is when you do n't know the person because working with other people is not really easy so the problem i think is that one you need to know this person
i do n't know about this because in my opinion if you are a good worker you will be good working face to face or working at home so i do n't know
if you have a good team obviously you will have better results than if you are alone however i 'm the kind of person that prefers to work alone
kabuki performances are often held in there
i usually enjoy watching movies with english subtitles to learn english and i like action movies for example the avengers and ironman and so on
i have a brother i usually enjoy playing games or playing catchball playing music and so on with him
so i want to become a pilot in the future
in my opinion all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies it is a very good thing i have two reasons
first to travel airplane you have to go to the airport by car or bus or train on arrival at the airport first you need to check in at the counter and next go to document control and pass security control and then you can wait to board in front of the boarding gate and next after that all you can board the airplane and go to another place or another country anywhere on earth
well they can use many applications on the phone for example to learn english words they do not need to carry heavy books
i agree with this opinion because if they have any questions they can ask the teacher so that is my opinion
so i think group projects are needed for learning
yes i think so because if the students have any questions they can ask the teacher as soon as possible
from my point of view learning about other countries should be one of the most important issues in life due to the fact that if you are interested in learning about a new culture or learning a new language it is important to meet other people
what i enjoy the most in my spare time my free time is to be with friends to be with family
i am trying many things to improve my english
if i have the opportunity to learn a new skill i would probably choose to learn to play piano the reason is that i have always loved music
my opinion about students getting a part time job during the time they are at high school i mean during university is that there are a few advantages which mean that they can get money and they can be free and they can be independent from their parents and on the other hand there are a few disadvantages as for instance they have less time for studying they have less time for spending with their friends as well and with their girlfriend apart from that i think there is nothing wrong with that
factories and vehicles create some tiny particles in the air which are called pollution these tiny particles become part of the atmosphere and when they get in that and they mix with the clouds they convert into little drops of water and once it rains these drops of water fall down and come to the ground which causes tremendous damage to the environment it is called acid rain it is the wind that moves the particles from where the factories and vehicles are to the natural environment
it 's one of the best things people can do in order to recharge their batteries
well at the moment i am not having a lot of holidays because i am studying a lot but if i had holidays i would go to the beach and to see the mountains
let me have a few seconds to collect my thoughts
i love this question because nowadays i am studying nursing and i really love this job very much
well the advantages maybe are if they get money to pay for their career they will help their families and get some new skills for their future but as far as i 'm concerned i think that it 's very useful to work while you are studying because this way you can prepare for the real world
if you are thinking of going on holiday you may want to know some tips to travel by plane first of all you may choose the way to get to the airport then you must do the check in showing your passport or identification card at the control place there there will be a security agent and you must be very patient with it then if you have to wait till your plane leaves you can have a coffee then you are going abroad and then you enjoy your trip thank you
nowadays technology is a very good way to find out whatever you need about all kinds of things you need to know for your job
well to be honest this is not a topic i can really talk about
no i am not so sure about that because when you are reading alone you have more concentration and you may get some skills reading alone
ok i live in a rural area so it is the best
in my holidays i often go to the park to play soccer with my friends who are majoring in engineering which is the same as me
i often go the park to play soccer with my brother who is a family member and we always enjoy it
oh that 's a good question in the future i would like to be an airline pilot so there are two reasons i want to be an airline pilot and the first one is i like to control something and the second one is i like to be a member of a team
so there are two advantages that students who get jobs to pay for their university studies have and the first one is students can improve their like communication skills in the job the part time job and the second one is that they can learn about how to manage money and the disadvantage is that if they have so much like work it 's gon na be they do n't have much time to study which is the most important thing for a student and in my opinion students should get jobs i mean you know like communication skills and experience in the job are very useful and important for society
all right so i am talking about what you need to do to travel by airplane so there are one two three four five six seven eight procedures and the first step is that you travel to the airport by car by bus or by train and then when you arrive at the airport you have to check in at the counter and you have to show your documents and the people at the counter check the documents and then also you have to pass a security check and then you have time to wait to like take a rest or have a coffee and then after that you will board the airplane and then enjoy your flight
okay so i 'm talking about how we can use technology more effectively to study and i think the best way to use technology to study is to use like an application on a smartphone
yeah i agree with that i mean you know face to face like studying and learning is really good for like communication with other people
in group projects a student can get communication skills for example like if there is someone who does n't know about something and someone can teach them that is good
i mean you just go to the class and listen to a lecture so it 's easy to do it
i think it is not so important to have modern learning facilities in the school i mean you know if there are it 's better but it does n't matter if we have them or not
i have always been interested to learn about other countries actually i have been living in italy and in new zealand as well because i want to learn from other cultures the way that they live the way that they eat and everything about that new place
most of my free time i 'm outside we can say that we go climbing mountain biking and hiking
i have many techniques to improve my english one of them is trying to speak in english with every english speaking person that i find and on the other hand i try to watch every movie and every t v show in english if i can
probably i would choose to learn to ride a motorbike i 've never been a good driver not even of cars so for the last two years i have been seriously thinking about getting a cool motorbike but on the other hand i do n't have the license
like every decision in life when we work while we are studying at university there are some advantages and disadvantages one good advantage is when you are working and studying at the same time you can use the theory you 've learnt and knowledge that you are getting when you are studying and put it into practice when you work at the same time that part time work will give you some economic resources that you can use in your daily life on the other hand it has some disadvantages as well for example you have less time to spend with your friends you have less time to study and you have less time to practice sport so in my opinion it 's all about finding a good balance between your part time job your study time and your work time
acid rain is one of the main consequences of our activity as human beings on this planet it all starts with our factories and our vehicles that produce smoke that smoke carries many acid particles that go up into the sky why do i say in our food because those particles get into the water and that water has the fishes that we will eat later so in the end all that pollution gets into our own bodies at the same time that rain gets into the fruit that we eat as well as into the forests and on the farms so
it 's that simple processed food does n't give you enough calories processed food poisons you so stop
drinking water is as important as breathing we actually need water to survive we just have to think that most of our body is water so we have to replace that amount of water by drinking at least one litre per day at least
yes it 's absolutely essential to do exercise every day when we say that we do n't have to think about doing a sport when we say exercise it can be walking around your neighborhood
i agree with that but on the other hand the reality is that there are people who can just sleep for six hours and they work really well it just depends on the person
technology has mainly bad effects on people because they do n't use it in the right way technology can provide us with so many apps which can teach us how to eat how to exercise and how to sleep well
a lot i 've been studying other countries since i was a little kid so i can say a lot
i like to enjoy it by doing some sport namely playing some football then i enjoy hanging out with my friends
i think it is to interact with native english speakers so they can advise me how to speak their language properly and studying some grammar and some vocabulary
the power of communication because i think it is very important to communicate with other people in a good way so they can have a good image of us
university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because it helps them to interact with others and know the world of work better besides that it helps them to earn some money the disadvantages they will have less free time to enjoy fun times in my opinion i think they should do part time jobs because it has more advantages than disadvantages
the pollution begins with vehicles and factories they create pollution that goes up into the air when it goes up into the air it transports acid particles in the smoke when they reach the air they are carried by winds the wind makes them reach the clouds but some of them end up falling as dust the others that reached the clouds they mix with cloud water
like i said before i think you should drink a lot of water and eat a lot of vegetables and besides this you should eat meat as well it keeps you fit strong and healthy i think
once again like i said before it is important to do exercise during the day it keeps you active and it is good for your mental health as well as your physical health
it depends on the person some need to sleep eight hours some need to sleep less some more it depends on the person basically everyone is different
it has had a huge positive effect because it gives you a lot of information about your body and what you should eat or drink and keeps you aware of dangers
i live in a big house with four floors and it 's a massive house i live with my family and i share a room with my daughter which is sometimes very difficult because she is very demanding so that 's what it is
when i 'm on holiday i love surfing and when i am on the beach i feel very relaxed and i think going to the beach is the best way to forget about all the problems that you have in your daily life
i love spending time with my sister because she is very similar to me and we spend time talking about magazines clothes businesses
i am training to be a teacher so i aim to have that goal in the future i want to become a teacher teach economics and probably teach spanish to foreign people so yeah that 's what it is
the advantage to having a job while you are studying at university is the free time that you are going to have to spend with your colleagues
when you have to take a flight the first thing that you have to do is obviously to travel to the airport you can take your car you can go by bus and you can take a train when you are already in the airport you can have some coffee or have some meals in the duty free to prepare yourself to do the check in why do you need to do the check in you need to do the check in to show your passport and to give your ticket to the woman or man who is at the window in order to take the plane
students can use youtube videos for example to have more information about a topic they can for example use podcasts listen to podcasts while they are running while they are doing sport and that could be a very good option
i think it 's true learning face to face with a teacher is better but it 's true that nowadays there are a lot of tools online where you can speak with a computer like i 'm doing now and it 's really useful
they can learn how to work in a team they can learn how to be a good leader leadership is very important for working in a multinational company for example
i think reading alone is actually very effective you can prepare yourself be in a relaxed environment in your room in your living room and for me it 's more effective than attending lectures
i think at the moment it 's very important for universities to do that because we are in very difficult times
i 'm so interested because i think it 's an important thing in our daily life
we love playing football playing basketball watching films walking our dog in the countryside
the most similar person in my family is my mum
i would like to live in spain maybe in the north of spain
in my opinion it is a very interesting topic i agree with it it has both advantages and disadvantages the main advantage is that it can make you feel better but you should not obsess about it
first the bees collect nectar from flowers then bees make honey from the nectar in beehives then beekeepers collect the honey from beehives
i think it does have importance but not as much as we think
i think the most difficult thing is being far from your home from your parents from your friends from your girlfriend it 's the most difficult thing
the students can learn about the food the culture the language the philosophy the weather
i agree with this i believe it can improve your life as it has improved the lives of others
i 'm interested in that a lot actually my first degree is in world economics so i am really interested in communicating with people from other cultures this is partially why i came to one of the most multicultural cities in the world toronto
basically my hobby is the same as my primary occupation i enjoy learning languages english is not the only foreign language that i can speak i can also speak french quite fluently and a bit of german however my german got a bit rusty over time just because of the lack of time for maintenance
i strongly believe that the most natural and the most efficient way to improve any language is to speak to native speakers so whenever i have the chance and the opportunity i try to communicate with as many native speakers i can encounter as possible
well it would definitely be coding because i think this is an essential skill not just in software engineering but in so many other fields from linguistics to accounting to financial analysis
well i know that many people have different approaches towards the idea of students doing part time jobs while they are studying on the one hand there are some advantages to this like learning proper time management developing interpersonal skills being able to communicate with people from different backgrounds however there are some disadvantages associated with it as well for example some students may find it hard to prioritise their studies over their part time job and they can get carried away with what they do in their part time job easily so i do n't think it is always an advantageous situation for the student to do both
so this picture represents the cycle of acid rain in nature i wish it was nice healthy rain but unfortunately this is not the case so essentially the way acid rain originates is that pollution is evaporated from factory chimneys and vehicles into the atmosphere and acid particles in the form of smoke are carried by the wind towards the upper layers of the atmosphere and then they are carried further in different directions after which some acid particles fall as dust and some other acid particles mix with cloud water
well i would definitely advise that they eat as many vegetables and fruits as possible and that they eat regularly and avoid eating just before bed or eating too much during their lunchtime
i think it 's definitely very important to drink lots of water although i know some scientists are starting to contest this premise so essentially drinking anywhere between five to eight glasses of water per day is considered healthy
well i would say it is essential to do exercise at least every other day every day would be ideal but unfortunately i know it may not necessarily be feasible for everyone
well it depends on the person i know some friends of mine can easily cope with six hours of sleep whereas i am not this kind of person i need more hours of sleep eight hours is an ideal number but sometimes i sleep more
well it depends on how you look at it of course there are lots of negative effects like we 're becoming more and more sedentary just because of technology we 're not glued to our screens just at work
so we have to take care of it
we enjoy playing golf but if the weather conditions are not good we will go shopping or watch movies to enjoy ourselves
my son is the most similar to me although i 'm not sure if he is so happy that he is similar to me but everybody points out that his attitude is quite similar to mine that 's very fine
if i can select wherever i want i want to live near the sea because my hobby is fishing so i can enjoy fishing every day after retirement
there 's no doubt that fitness is really essential for students to keep healthy so the biggest advantage is keeping students healthy and they can concentrate on studying a lot but the disadvantage is students will have less time to study but as a result my opinion is that i agree with making time for fitness classes
so from the beginning at the beginning of course bees collect nectar from flowers and farmers collect honey from beehives and they will pack the honey into small bottles and deliver them to the supermarket where we can buy the honey so
of course the language in the country is well key however the other and really essential factor is safety safety is required for studying
because it is a second language the speaker also takes great care with their body language it 's easy for us to understand a second language
in addition to the language the lifestyle and culture is also a very big handicap for students especially when first entering the country
i fully agree with that students should live alone and independently abroad because they are away from their parents
my favourite time of year in italy is the summer because the weather is very good and you have time to spend with friends your family i especially like to play soccer and other sports
listening to and reading the news is very important because you have to know what is the situation in your locality in your city in your town in your country you have to be informed
when i was a child i really spent my free time playing some video game like fifa or playing soccer with my brother or spending time with my mom
actually i do n't really know but i think it could be continue with the family company because i know that i can help to improve some processes like sales or something
as you know nowadays all university courses should include a period of practical work experience and it is very good but do you know what are the advantages of that it 's easy the biggest advantage of that is that it could help you to get a lot of new knowledge or new experience or something that you would be using in the future in your area of work but there are a lot of disadvantages for example you wo n't be able to spend the time that you would like to with your friends or you will be stressed in the future but in my opinion it is important for all students to have a period of practical work experience because it will help them in the future
as you know nowadays there are a lot of apps or websites that you can use to listen to music online but we will focus on three tunes net that is the red one music now that is the blue one and songs for you that is the yellow one and as you can see on average the blue one that is music now has the highest number of people listening to their music per day but you can see too that tunes net has a considerable increase until the fifth day
a good team leader has to have some skills to improve and develop the performance of the team for example leadership honesty good communication things like that
i do n't think there are a lot of problems if you are working in small teams but one could be that the work wo n't be divided equally so you can have a lot of work
i do n't think that teamwork has to be always face to face between the team members but most of the time it could be helpful because in this way you have more opportunity to speak with your members and have good communication
yes i completely agree with that you will achieve better results if you are in a team than if you are alone
it is a large city it has got a river it has a circus and lots of theatres there are lots of parks in our city and very very many shopping centres
when i am on holiday i enjoy travelling to other places meeting new people and seeing new places and taking lots of photos of these places
he is twelve and he 's a very interesting boy it is interesting to speak with him and take him to some games
i think i will not have a new job in the future because i 'm too old to start a new job but if i could have a new job i think it could be as an instructor or teacher
i think there are no advantages at all for students to get jobs to pay for their university studies because they will spend time working not studying i think part time jobs for students are good just in cases when a student works on their future speciality so they can be more experienced and confident in their area of speciality
to travel by airplane first you need to travel to the airport then you should check in and pass document control when you show your passport and security control where you show your things and goods after this you wait for your plane you can wait for some hours it depends on how early or late you arrived at the airport then you board and after this when you take your place you can fly so your plane takes off
students can use the internet to find out information they need
i think it is really best when you have got a good teacher so when you are lucky enough to have the teacher of your dreams the best teacher of your life it is better to study face to face with him
working as a group students can develop communication skills of course and to work in a team is a good skill for future work too
different students have different styles of learning for some students attending lectures is better but for other students attending lectures is not good they prefer to read books and it is better for them than attending lectures
modern facilities can make lectures more interesting for students
i really enjoy visiting monuments and in general different points of interest of a city and i really like to relax with my husband at the beach
i like spending time with my mum because we really like to go shopping together and do exercise when at the weekends we can do it and we spend a lot of time together
i think that students should get jobs to pay for their university studies if they do n't have their parents ' support but i think that it would be better if the students only focused on their studies because due to their job they would n't have enough time to study because the timetables for jobs generally do not fit very well with their studies and i think that it would be better if they are onlt focused on their education
first of all this journey begins with taking a means of transport a bus or a car for instance or maybe a train then you will arrive at the airport and you have to do the check in check your boarding pass at the desk with your passport then you can find the police on the security staff and you pass several controls then you have to wait a few hours until the flight arrives and then you go on board and take off
for instance technology 's a good tool for learning languages because students can practise more about the languages watching videos for instance and listening to music and i think this is good
i really think that learning face to face with the teacher is the best option because you are more confident with your teacher
and this helps students to work in groups and share a lot
not necessarily i think that attending lectures is a good option for listening to the opinions of other people
i think that 's really important because learning facilities help us to study more and better and i think that they should provide more facilities like computers or tablets something like that
i enjoy playing tennis with my colleague and i can reduce my stress by playing tennis and moving your body is good for your health
i 'm always with my sister and we watch netflix together and sometimes we go on a trip to enjoy a vacation
i would like to work as a pilot to save many people 's lives because now we are suffering from covid nineteen and there are a lot of vaccines i would like to send them all over the world
first of all the advantage is students can know about how much university will cost that makes students more motivated to learn at the university that is the bad thing but in my opinion it is good to get a job while at the university because it will be more motivating to learn at the university
today i 'm going to talk about what steps people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all use public transportation to travel to the airport after arriving at the airport you should go to the check in counter and finish checking in after that you should pass the document control and show all your baggage to security and after that you should wait at the gate at that time you should go to the toilet or the caff for a coffee or go shopping then board the airplane and take off
well students can use a tablet for studying and that means students can study everywhere anytime
i think it is a very good thing because if you have a question you can ask the teacher or your friends as soon as possible
on a group project students can improve their communication skills at the time
yes it is true attending lectures if you have a question you can ask the teacher or your friends at the time
i think that it is not so important for universities to introduce learning facilities modern learning facilities because we have a lot of books and that makes people study more
oh sure i live in an apartment with three bedrooms a bathroom a living room a large table and i also live with two cats the cats belong to my sister we also have a light kitchen and a washing room
we most of the time have a picnic together we eat we cook together too sometimes we go to the movies together and i also like to visit some friends of mine
well i love to spend time with my sister we are very alike we enjoy doing the same things the same movies and we also have very similar world views about some topics like politics the environment and also about art it is great fun to be with her
i would like to have two types of job i 'd like to be a professor at university but also a curator at a musuem at the university i 'd like to teach history of art especially contemporary art and african art
they can build their networks and it can also influence their future well there are also disadvantages they will probably have less time to study and to prepare themselves for exams and the worst thing is that they can engage less with their university activities and it can truly damage their academic prospects well from my point of view it is better for students not to work during their courses because they have to dedicate themselves full time to their university studies and not to a job that will probably not have any relationship with their future profession then i guess they should take a student loan or ask for money from their parents this is what i think about this
first of all you have to get to the airport by bus by train or personal car also by taxi when you arrive at the airport you have to look for the airline company and to maybe leave your luggage there after that you got ta look for the officers to show your document to them then you have to wait until your flight 's being called you can have a coffee go to the restroom and when your flight is being called you have to go to the gate and then enter the airplane and finally you begin to fly
they can access youtube channels they can have online books they can also download plenty of p d fs of books and there are also applications
it may be better to learn directly with a teacher but it 's not the only way of learning people can learn through the internet via skype people can also learn alone at home with books well i guess that the internet is the biggest teacher nowadays
the most important thing about working together in groups and so on is to exchange ideas and to receive feedback about your own ideas and also to give feedback about your colleague 's ideas
i think it depends on each student we ca n't generalize about such a thing some of them they like to go to attend a lecture and to get to know the teacher and to deepen their relationship some others like just to stay at home and read and this is more effective for them
well from my point of view modern learning facilities they play a very important role in the development of each student they also have a very important influence on the future of the students because they can learn more effectively
i 'm very interested in the environment because we are devastating this world
well we like to play football we like to read books
maybe one of my brothers and maybe my son as well we are very similar
in this world
well i agree on the other hand as a disadvantage i think it could cause some injuries and some pupils could be exhausted after fitness class but in general i agree i think that a healthy mind in a healthy body is a good thing yes so i agree and i think it 's necessary also
the first step is the bees collect nectar from flowers the second step is that bees make honey from nectar in beehives the third step is the beekeepers collect honey from beehives the fourth step is when the honey is put in glass jars and then the fifth step is the honey is delivered to the shops and the last step is when the honey is in the supermarkets
well i would like them to provide me with a job to earn some money for my living expenses and a teacher i would like to have a teacher for me
it would expand my options to find work in other countries and my own cultural level i think it would be good for me
the local music the folk music and the local holidays
i totally agree ok they go off to another country they are away from their mother 's nest and have to do things by themselves i totally agree
i love learning about foreign countries and about their culture about their history about their politics because this is what it fills my soul actually
i do n't have that much free time but when i can i love travelling and i love to go to the museum just to educate myself about different things and also to read about political history
the best way for me to improve my english it 's to watch english or american channels and also to watch some t v shows in english
if it was possible i think i would have liked to learn how to fly but it 's not possible actually so i would like to just speak another language like chinese
one of the advantages of working as a student it 's to be financially independent and also to know how the professional environment works and how to manage different environments but there are also drawbacks to this for example one of the most inconvenient things is we can be tired i mean students could be tired from their part time jobs it depends on the job that they do delivering or shopping or whatever but it has to be short
acid rain is one of the most damaging phenomena for the environment today but how does this form in the environment these particles in smoke form smog that spreads in the air some of them continue their journey to mix with clouds just a reminder that clouds are made up of water and acid particles become a part of the clouds consequently depending on the temperature rain or snow may contain a large number of particles and acid particles which leads to acid rain or acid snow which can be really damaging to the environment
a healthier lifestyle starts with nutrition and as far as i 'm concerned we must stop eating between meals and drink a lot of water like about one point five litres a day or two litres per day whatever
our bodies are made up of ninety percent water so we should keep that level all day because this is where our bodies get all their energy so we should drink a lot of water about two litres per day
the more we sleep the longer we live so in my opinion we should keep a constant eight hours of sleep each night and even ten hours would be perfect for an adult for example
the advantage of technology is that now we can track every aspect of our bodies and our health and we do n't have to go to the doctor all the time but the other side is we 're so dependent on that
i usually enjoy spending my free time by dancing i tend to watch choreographies and learn them by watching videos and slowing them down that way i can really learn the details and dance them with my partner
firstly the advantages i see in studying and doing part time jobs would be that they will have way more money to do things in their free time and to pay for their study fees on the other hand we have the disadvantages one big important disadvantage would be having less time to study which could lead to having lower grades so it will be a bit more difficult in my opinion it would be a really good thing to have part time jobs while studying so they can have more money
then the acid particles that are in that smoke are carried by the wind the wind makes some acid particles fall as dust which could lead to the rivers and some lakes being less clean then the other acid particles will mix with cloud water which could lead to rain and snow with acid particles in it which will lead to damage to the environment and kill some living things such as trees
i would recommend going to a nutritionist so they can tell them exactly what they need and what their body needs to have for maximum energy throughout the day
i do n't think we need to do exercise every day but i think it 's very important to do exercise at least two or three times a week so our body can keep its shape and to be a healthy weight
generally technology has really improved our health because we do n't have to waste as much energy as we used to with our new technology so i think it is an improvement
i 'm so interested because you can learn about other cultures so i think it is positive in every way
maybe the best way is talking with other people from england or the united states and you can learn a lot about english
maybe the italian language
some advantages of having jobs while you are studying are that you maybe see real life and you can afford to pay for some things and that will maybe help your parents with the university fees on the other hand some disadvantages are that you do n't have too much time for study and you will sleep less but in my opinion you are going to learn more about responsibilities and meet other people other workpeople so definitely it 's a good way to spend your time
that picture shows us how acid rain is a product of pollution on our planet first of all factories and vehicles make acid particles that are in smoke and finally we find that particles are in the clouds of the planet because they are carried by the wind so yeah there is important damage to the environment of our planet and we have to change that to have a better planet
maybe i think that good habits for eating are to eat a lot of fruit five times a day and eat some salad two times a week
it 's very important to drink water because sometimes we are confused about drinking water and being hungry
for a person to have a healthy lifestyle i think that it 's very important or essential to do exercise every week because it 's s basic part of a healthy lifestyle
i think that it depends on the use of the technology that people make because you can use technology for doing exercise well but maybe you can use technology to watch netflix so it depends
it 's very important for me because if i do n't listen to and read the news i do n't know information about my country
i want to be a pilot in the future so i am studying to be a pilot
so i think i have no idea if there are disadvantages and then students can get more experience so that that is absolutely a very good direction to go in
first of all do you see the colours clearly red is tune net blue is music now and yellow is songs for you on the first day red will start in third place and blue will start in first place this relationship does not change until the fifth day and on the seventh day the final day rocky is red was first blue overtaken by red was second and yellow was third
i think good team leaders can talk to anyone so good team leaders can get everyone 's ideas
that is very good
i do n't think so recently covid nineteen has affected our lifestyle so we talk online like in zoom so i do n't think so
i am really interested in learning about other countries because in my opinion the world 's beauty is its diversity so discovering other cultures is the best way to open your mind to other people
i enjoy spending my free time by passing time with my family and my friends doing a lot of shopping working on myself working out and that 's it
the best way for me to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people
if i could learn a new skill it would be boxing or acting or maybe modelling and improving my skills at school
the advantages of it are that first of all students can earn some money and feel responsible but the disadvantages are that it deprives students of a lot of time they ca n't do their homework because part time jobs take a lot of time in addition to many hours of school so that 's it
acid rain has a lot of bad effects on the environment so first of all it starts from factories and vehicles because they create a lot of pollution then this pollution transforms into acid particles which are in smoke then these acid particles are carried by wind and some of them fall as dust on the ground which damages the environment but other acid particles mix with cloud water and these acid particles are transformed into rain or snow so we call it acid rain and this acid rain is very bad for the environment
having good eating habits is one of the most important things for having a healthy lifestyle first of all having good eating habits helps us to feel more comfortable in our bodies and to feel more healthy every single day and more powerful
drinking water is very necessary if you want to stay energetic all day if you want to feel hydratated and healthy you have to drink water as much as you can many times a day
doing exercise is a way to be confident in yourself you feel powerful you feel healthy and you feel like you 've achieved something every time you do exercise you feel powerful
i 'm not the best person to talk about sleeping because i do n't sleep a lot which is really bad you have to sleep a lot minimum eight hours a night because you have to feel energetic for the day without it you ca n't
so having good eating habits drinking water doing exercise and sleeping are the main things to keep a healthy lifestyle because without them you ca n't feel good in yourself
i 'm very interested in the environment because we have an obligation to save the environment for our health and for the health of our children
my friends and i enjoy going out to the countryside together to hike
yes my family and me we are very similar for example my children the older one is very similar to me and she looks a lot like me and the youngest is very similar to me because he 's blond like me
in the future i think i 'd like to live on the beach because i love the sea i love to walk on the beach and i prefer to stay there when i am retired
and among the disadvantages we can find that the students lose a lot of time doing sport and they do n't dedicate this time to their studies in my opinion maybe the fitness classes would be better on the weekend or one day per week at most but not for all every day it is a bad idea to dedicate a school day to practising sports
i will speak about honey from the moment that the honey is produced by the bees until the moment that you can find this honey in your shop the bees collect nectar from flowers and they go to the hive to make honey from nectar in beehives so after that the beekeepers collect honey from beehives
and so i think it 's very important for people to study in a second language because they improve their language skills
and also it 's very difficult to get to know to meet other people in a new country if you do n't know people or have friends
the question is interesting because they improve their knowledge about a new country and also they know about the culture in this country and how the people live there
well definitely i 'm quite interested in learning about countries that 's something that i appreciate a lot
i do enjoy spending my free time in many different ways but certainly the way i enjoy spending my time is watching movies because i 'm addicted to films especially those created in the sixties and seventies
after all these years i can say that the best way to improve my english is to listen and speak doing those kinds of activities every single day is certainly improving my language level
i am not going to hesitate answering this question definitely that skill will be to play the piano to play the piano would be a dream for me
oh okay great i will enjoy talking about this topic the part time jobs while you are studying advantages a clear advantage besides the money you will earn one great advantage is you will have some independence in your life and you will not depend on your parents so that is extremely important for me and a clear disadvantage of that is part time jobs are not created for everyone because not everyone has the commitment to fulfil all their responsibilities for their studies their classes and their part time jobs so those students are not going to fulfill all the requirements what is my opinion everyone must be aware whether they 're in group one or two
acid rain it 's something that involves everyone in society you know acid rain it 's represented in every single season of the year it does n't matter if you are in summer winter fall autumn you will see the risks of acid rain every day in your life it is a cycle that involves many factors vehicles trees some plants and at the end the damage to the environment it 's quite important and significant so in the end it destroys our nature and our lives
my most significant advice definitely would be if you care about your health about your physical appearance and about being good looking and what 's more about your sexuality you should be concerned about your eating habits do n't eat hamburgers
to drink lots of water is extremely important for our health because you know we are composed of seventy percent water so if a body like our body is composed of water and you do n't drink water come on something is wrong
people say that just because science has proved that eight hours is a cool average for our health by the way you should try ten or twelve hours and it will be fine
technology has had a negative effect on people 's health
i live in a small town with my wife in a small flat but we are moving to a new flat bigger than this
when i am on holiday i enjoy travelling i like to travel around the world i 've already visited more than thirty countries between european countries and countries all over the world
i like to spend my free time with my wife and with my parents and also with my nephews i have nine nephews and i enjoy the time i can spend with them so much
in the future and more or less in a few years no more than three years i would like to get a job as a civil servant
so the advantage of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies the main advantage in my opinion is that the students can appreciate their parents ' effort to pay for their studies and on the other hand the main disadvantage is that they ca n't focus on their studies because they have to work
so if you want to travel by airplane first you should go to the airport i prefer to go by public transport and then you have to do the check in to get your boarding pass after that you have to show your documents at the security control and after that you have to wait for your flight maybe you 'll wait one or two hours before your flight takes off
i think that nowadays with technology you can learn face to face with teachers
it depends and there 's not only one way to learn for some people it could be more interesting to read alone
it is very important to provide learning facilties for students but not all teachers can use i c ts properly
it depends on the country but i really like to learn new things so i think i 'm really interested
i do quite a lot of things but i 'm daydreaming all the time i am always daydreaming when i 'm walking i also really like reading listening to music and watching movies
i think my english is quite good except the talking part so speaking with someone native would be helpful i think
i really would love to play the piano also i really want to be good at cooking it would be helpful
apart from that getting money while studying is almost everyone 's dream being separated from their family it 's not always easy to ask for money from parents so earning their own money would be so helpful really boost their confidence i think those are the advantages and my final opinion is some university students should do that
okay the main cause of acid rain is pollution waste products from vehicles and some factories are emitted in gas form and some acid particles from the smoke go into the air and then are carried by the wind after that one part of these particles falls from the sky as dust while the other part mixes with water in clouds this is what we call acid rain
the first thing they should do is cut out junk food if they are really addicted to it they should start small and then aim higher and i also think a gluten free diet is better i do that
it 's quite important we need to drink water at least three litres per day and it really helps homeostasis it is great
not every day but we should do exercise regularly the days that we do n't do exercise we should walk instead we should keep ourselves active
depends on the people like i need more than eight hours sleeping is a really good way to reduce toxins in our brain
it has generally a good effect it is really positive we can do surveys we keep track of our patients
yeah i live in a very quiet city it 's located in the centre of my country mexico
usually in my holidays i enjoy going on some trips and spending time with my family with my friends that live in other countries and yeah
i think that could be my mom i have a good actually a great relationship with her and also i really love spending my time with my dog and her name is freda
the advantages of all students getting jobs to pay for university studies i think are that you increase your experience in the industrial or commercial field and it helps so much in your development but the disadvantage is that normally you do n't have time to do all the activities or assignments that you must do and my opinion is that it 's good to look for a balance with those things
if you are travelling by airplane first of all you have to travel to the airport and then do the check in with a receptionist and also you must provide your documents to the security personnel and then you board and yeah finally you board your flight
and it 's important to understand the project
i think that depends on the kind of person for me it is better to learn alone because i think that i concentrate more but attending lectures helps other people so much
it 's very important you are in a place where you feel very comfortable and where it is very easy to learn and improve every day in the field that you want improve in
i have actually a deep interest in learning about other countries because i believe it 's a good way to improve and develop our knowledge
i do n't have so much spare time but from time to time i like to go running on the street and also in the woods
i would love to know how to play an instrument for example piano or violin i think it 's so difficult but no pain no gain so i 'll probably start learning about music and about the basics
going to university is in itself a difficult decision so having a part time job could bring benefit and disdvantage at the same time first of all we are going compare the advantage and the disadvantage of having this kind of job firstly we have to know that university is difficult so we have to have enough time to do our homework hang with friends and have the freedom to go out and spend some time with your classmates and of course you have to study for your exams so having a part time job could waste your time and maybe you wo n't be able to study enough on the other hand having this kind of job could help you earn some money
welcome ladies and gentlemen to my presentation today we are going to talk about acid rain acid rain is a common problem nowadays and we have to find a way of eliminating it the vehicles and the factories as we all know cause pollution and this pollution usually creates acid particles that go into the smoke of these factories these acid particles could be carried by wind and could also mix with water in the clouds if this happens then acid rain is going to fall onto the ground and damage the environment as well as humans animals and the fields of the farmers for example
for all those people that want to develop healthy eating habits i would say that they have to have strong willpower to achieve their objective but if they have a never say die attitude i 'm sure they are going to have a healthy life
drinking water is extremely important for human beings because we are made up of a high percentage of water
from my point of view doing exercise is so important in our daily life of course if we are too busy we can just skip the exercise and do it the next day
the study shows that human beings have to sleep at least eight hours a day so i completely agree with this statement because we have to be healthy also in our sleep
it depends technology could have a bad or a good effect or an advantage or a disadvantage it all depends on the way we use this technology if we are too attached to this technology we can develop an addiction and this is a really bad problem
i live in a small town that has a lot of mountains nearby and it 's in the basque country near the sea in the north of spain
when i 'm on holiday i enjoy visiting different places so i like to get to know different places because i think it 's very interesting visiting different places
it is true that it is very important that students get jobs to pay for their university studies because they have the possibility to be independent and not depend on their parents ' economic support and if they need money to pay for their university it 's important that their parents help them in my opinion it 's a good idea that students work and they earn a lot of money to pay for their studies
now i 'll explain what you need to do to travel by airplane then when you get to the airport you need to check in your suitcase then you need to pass document control and you need to pass security control then if you have more time you can wait in the bar or in the cafe then you go to the airplane
i think that if you read alone you will concentrate more than in these lectures
i am not an environmentalist but i do wanna devote more time for myself to learn more about our planet and the environment around us because i do think for human sustainability we do need to be careful
and we love the ones that are not thrilling or are not very hectic and we love to have fun together
i am most similar to my mom because she is very outgoing and friendly to everyone and for me i think this is very important because treating everyone else in a very friendly way they are going to give back to you the same thing and family to me is very important
i do n't have a city in mind yet but i would love to travel as much as i can and right now i have n't been to europe for a while and i want to go to england and greece and try a lot of places and i want to experience a lot of places before i decide
the advantages for students who do a fitness class during the school day are they can have free time to improve their fitness and it helps them to build a healthy body and the disadvantages for them are that it may extend the time for them to study and also they may turn their attention to the fitness classes so that they might not be interested in their academic courses anymore
the diagram is about honey from flower to shop the first step of honey production is nectar being collected by the bees from flowers the bees make honey from nectar in beehives then the beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put it into jars after putting honey in jars there will be a truck to deliver the honey to the shop the final step of honey production is that it will be for sale on the shelf
well i think that first of all the most important thing is the safety of that country after that it should be the climate of the country whether it is suitable for the student
well the benefit of that is that first of all you can really know how to speak a second language and after that in lots of foreign countries the culture is so different and it 's a joy to learn another language to know their culture through that
well first of all the difficulty must come from the influence of the culture because there are so many different habits of other countries ' people and also the difficulty may be because of the language of course
well the fastest way for a student to learn about the local culture is to become friends with some local people and in that case they can take you to maybe their festivals and in that case you can learn about the culture
i agree with that idea because when you study in another country it 's most likely that you are on your own and you have to do everything by yourself because there are no parents alongside you and so in that case you can become more independent
it 's quite good i like it
well there are a number of things that i like i think that the thing that i enjoy most may be football
well that 's a tricky question it 's difficult to answer because we are a large family but i would say that maybe my grandmother we usually watch television at night and this is a good moment for both of us because we catch up with each other
i have studied psychology and ontology
i think that the main advantage is that they are going to be able to pay their student loans and this is going to give them a sense of responsibility but i also think that there are some disadvantages to it that is that the time that they are going to spend on those jobs they are n't going to be able to use for studying and well studying is very important for getting a better job in the future so it could be a downside in my opinion it 's a good thing having a job and not just because of the money but also because of the future prospects that the students will have about their future jobs they will have their first experience of how it is going to be
while it is important to arrive at the airport two hours before take off it is also necessary to be aware of the things that are allowed to pass through security for example we are not able to travel with metallic gadgets or any kind of weapons a knife it 's impossible to pass through the security control as we have arrived two hours before take off we are going to have a quiet time a lot of time to wait so we can spend it in the cafeteria restaurants or any kind of gift shop that there are in the airport and then it 's just waiting for the hostess to ask us to board
i have experienced both sides of both and i would say that maybe face to face learning or school is better than the one online so it 's more comfortable
there are many things
well it depends on the people but many people just by reading something can understand everything so it really depends on personal preferences and abilities
i 'm very interested because it 's very important for everyone
i like to go swimming or ride a bike or sometimes go for a walk and spend time with my family
i think that is my father
i think that it is very important students do fitness classes because it is healthy for students i think that it has to continue
well the steps for making honey are first bees collect nectar from the flowers then the bees fly to the beehives and they make honey from the nectar then it is put into jars and then some people take it to the different places to sell it
i think that the principal thing that they have to consider is the prices or the currency that is used and where they are going to live is very important
i think that it is very important because it can open some doors and opportunities for the students if the students can speak two or maybe three languages for their future professions
it is difficult really difficult because they have to go away from their family and their houses they have to live a new kind of life and it 's very difficult
now i 'm living in an apartment with two bedrooms and with one of my colleagues it 's very convenient and you know the view is very good from there because it 's on the fifteenth floor
well on holiday i like to stay with my colleagues going out together visiting some museum or you know heritage sites as well
currently i do n't have a clear view about my future i hope i can take a job that does not require lots of time but has a very high salary yeah
well the advantages of university students taking a job to cover the payment of university fees are first of all they can get more familiar with the working environment and after graduation this will benefit their job seeking or even career development so in my opinion the university students should take part time jobs in accordance with the regulations of the university to guarantee the study time and yeah
the diagram shows the procedure of travelling by airplane first of all you need to travel to the airport you can choose any kind of transportation like your private car or train or bus to arrive at the airport and then you have to hand your document to security to pass the security check and wait until the boarding time to you know get on the plane
there are several ways for students to use technology in their studies the most important one is a search engine like google they can search for any kind of material that they want from the internet and use it
well i agree with this idea
well in a group project the most important thing they can obtain is group cooperation with other people which will be very important in the working environment because most of us will work in a company
well yes i think attending a lecture is very important because if you study alone it 's a big challenge to your self discipline but if you attend a lecture the teacher will control your studies
well i think learning facilities are very important at university
i think that the environment is very important for our lives because without the environment there is n't life
i love my family
i am happy to talk about this topic because for me fitness classes are very important because they are very important for a healthy life schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes in my opinion it is very important to do fitness classes because you will be strong and more intelligent
i 'm going to speak about honey from flower to shop the bees collect nectar from flowers next bees make honey from nectar in beehives later beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives and put the honey in bottles next the beekeepers put the bottles in a vehicle
i think that is very important studying in another country because you will learn their language and about another culture
i think that the greatest difficulty of studying in another country is learning another language
when you study in another country you learn about the local culture
living in another country the person will be more independent
i 'm deeply interested in learning about other countries and my two favorite things to learn about them are trying their food and also learning some words from their language
i really enjoy relaxing in my house so i spend my free time here in my house watching movies or some t v shows and eating popcorn or drinking coffee or something like that
i think that the best way to improve my english is through immersion i mean going to a country where english is spoken but the second best way to learn about english is watching t v shows in english and listening to music in english
i think that it will be cooking i mean right now i do n't enjoy it because i think that i do n't know how to do it correctly
okay i find some advantages in working and being a student at the same time some of them are that you can practice what you learn in school when you are working so you gain experience in the area and you also get to know people who are working in this area and you can do some networking in the field well i also think that it has disadvantages coz working and studying requires time and is a huge responsibility which could be so stressful in the end i think that it is very useful and students should do part time jobs while they are studying because in the end it has a positive impact on your experience and it could help you to find a job
today we 're gon na talk about acid rain acid rain is caused by pollution this pollution is principally emitted by factories and vehicles and we 're talking about smoke this smoke has some acid particles in it and these acid particles are carried by wind this acid rain is toxic so it has severe consequences for our environment because it damages not only our plants but also microorganisms in our soil
my advice to these people is that they plan their meals it could help you to be prepared when you are hungry and not fill up with this junk food that you can find in the streets
it 's difficult to determine how much is a lot but the recommendation is that you should drink at least two liters of water every day that 's what our body needs to maintain hydration
absolutely in my opinion it is vital to do exercise every day the recommendation is to do at least thirty minutes of exercise this can improve our health in a good way
i think that everybody is different someone can need just six hours of sleep and someone else can need nine hours of sleep
i think that it can have both on the one hand we can have all these apps and programs that are useful to track our habits of exercise or eating
i am interested in learning about other countries so much because i think learning more about other countries can give me a deeper insight into other cultures and broaden my horizons
i enjoy spending my free time reading books watching movies watching drama series and going out with my friends
as for improving my oral english i think it is better to speak as much as possible with your foreign friends and read as much as possible too
i think it would be cooking because cooking is an important skill for independent life and through cooking i can make delicious meals for my family to spread happiness and well being
i think the advantages are students can get more practical skills and combine what they have learned in their textbooks with their experiences through doing part time jobs but the disadvantages are that they may be easily distracted from class leading to poor grades so i think it is better to strike a balance between doing part time jobs and studying and students should choose the most appropriate part time jobs for themselves because part time jobs vary from person to person and they should choose their individual jobs
pollution given off from factories and vehicles contains smoke which acid particles are in and they are carried by the wind some of them fall as dust and others mix with cloud water to form rain or snow which is also called acid rain and acid rain can do harm to the environment which has raised people 's awareness of it
i think it is persistence and self discipline
i 'm in favour of it enough sleep can refresh your mind after a busy day and get you well prepared for the next day and sleep deprivation can make you stressed the next day
i 'm very interested in other countries because i really like other cultures and i like visiting them also i think that this is very important for you
in my free time i really like to be in nature sometimes i go to the park and look at the birds in the sky i really like relax
this is a difficult question because i think that there exist a lot of methods for learning english
maybe if i could learn one skill this would be learning a lot of languages because i really like other languages
i think that this is a controversial topic because it has a lot of advantages and also it has disadvantages for example you can make money if you work while you are studying but you spend a lot of time and this time you should spend studying if you want to pass the university exams for this reason i think that it 's better if you do n't work while you are studying but if you need the money you should work
i 'm going to talk about acid rain in this picture we can see the water cycle first of all we can see like factories and vehicles make pollution and this pollution is in the air next we can see the acid particles are in smoke and the acid particles are carried by wind
if you want good eating habits i think that you need to cook your own food
i think that it 's very important that you drink a lot of water because your body is made up of eighty percent water and you need this to live well
i think that it 's not necessary to do exercise every day of the week but if you want to stay in shape i recommend that you do exercise twice a week
i think that it 's very important that you sleep very well and eight hours a day but if one day you ca n't it 's not important
it 's a controversial topic because in general i think that technology it 's a good invention but it 's true that technology causes a lot of stress in a lot of people
it 's well known that the environment needs to be healthy for our future and we need to keep nature healthy and try to stop the pollution and contamination of the environment
my friends and i like to spend the time going to the cinema and going to restaurants or sometimes i host a dinner for them and we start to talk about our families our goals and catch up with each other
in my view the most similar to me is my mother because she has the same love for music classical music and orchestral music so we sometimes spend time listening to that kind of music and we enjoy it very much
in the future i see myself living in dubai because it 's a lovely city with amazing structures and amazing people amazing music it has always been my dream to live there
nowadays it 's very important to know the advantages and disadvantages of exercise for example on the one hand i can mention one advantage of the fitness classes would be that the school and college system would teach the students how to start a healthy life and include exercise in their routines on other hand one of the disadvantages would be that time they spend on fitness classes will not be used for feeding their brains
hello good morning today i 'm going to explain to you how honey is produced first of all everything starts with bees bees collect the nectar from flowers and secondly the bees make honey from nectar in beehives third the beekeepers collect that honey from beehives and put that honey into the well designed honey jars those honey jars are organized and then distributed for the company the company provides this honey to supermarkets and small shops thank you
in my opinion the advantages of studying in a second language will be that you can improve that language so that you can learn more about the language and start to talk with other people and get a good curriculum because of that
in my experience the most difficult thing about studying in another country is you are so far from your family
in my experience the best way to know more about the local culture is by taking part in their festivities and walking around the city going to the small markets so you can get more interested in the local culture
personally i would say that it really helps to become independent because being far away from your parents teaches you how to keep a home how to cook how to make money and other skills
in the holidays i like reading books
i do n't understand can you repeat the question please
because if they are working they wo n't study well and they are studying every day and all day because it is their future
to go to the airport you should take a car the bus or the train often you should go to check in your suitcase after that you have to submit your documentation to security you will have to wait and finally you will get on the plane often you should go to check in your suitcase after that you have to submit your documention to security you will have to wait and finally you will get on the plane
i am not sure but i think students have to use technology because it 's very important for their studies
i think modern learning facilities are very important because they are important for the students
today the pollution is very bad because there are a lot of cars and ships in the world and the environment is very important to the earth and i care about our planet
when i meet my friends i like to see or watch movies we go to the cinema
my father is similar to me because he likes football and a lot of sports like me and any father and he is tall like me and he is my family
in the future i would like to live out of europe for example i would like to live in london or england because there it is so beautiful and i 've learnt another language which is english
the advantage of doing fitness classes is you get to meet other people while you do sport and a second one is you get to practise another sport that you do n't know and if you do fitness classes these sports help you to concentrate to study and i have n't found any disadvantage in my opinion doing sports in classes in schools or colleges is very important for studying
i 'm going to explain how honey is produced first bees collect nectar from flowers then bees make honey from nectar in beehives and then beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives then they arrive at supermarkets
i think that a student chooses another country because they have learnt the language before and in the future they will meet other people
i think that students find it difficult studying in another country when they do not know the language it 's difficult studying a second language
i agree with you because students become independent when they live in another country he or she is able to become independent when he or she cooks or cleans the flat
i am interested in their countries and their cultures but mainly in their language
i like to spend my free time playing soccer watching many series and movies but what i like to do the most is sing it is what i love the most and i could do it all the time
i like to watch movies or read a lot in english but i think the best way is to speak with another person and practice practice all the time and this is the key to being better
i would like to learn to play any instrument as i said a few moments ago i like to sing and that combined with any instrument i think it could be amazing for me
in my opinion i think it 's a great option a great idea only if you have the time and the university allows it because these activities are very difficult i think part time jobs have a lot of advantages and maybe you will have enough money to go out with your friends go to parties go to the movies or the cinema and maybe you can pay for your gym but this has a lot of disadvantages because you wo n't have enough time to do your homework to pay attention in your classes and you wo n't have the time to study for your exams i think it 's very difficult
acid rain six steps happen two acid particles are in the smoke and then these particles go up to the sky and in the third step acid particles are carried by wind four some acid particles fall as dust number five other acid particles mix with cloud water and then the final step six acid particles are in rain or snow and this damages the environment
in addition to hydrating you we need water because our body needs a lot of water to perform various functions for example blood contains a lot of water and that water carries oxygen throughout our body to the cells
not every day but it 's very important that you do a lot of exercise because it 's healthy and your body needs this exercise to be healthy and that 's all
but if you sleep a little more it will not affect you much and everybody is different but sleeping eight hours will surely help your health
like everything it has its good and bad points unfortunately now the negative side is affecting us but if you know how to use technology it can help you to be healthier you can watch videos or even apps will help you have a healthy life
it is a beautiful place there is a park and nearby there are schools and beautiful lakes with birds
in the holidays i enjoy going to the beach and going to paris with my friends i love to travel and meet new people
i want to be a broker to sell houses and i wanna be rich in the future
in my opinion an advantage that you could have if you work is that you could pay for your own things you could buy clothes you could buy food you could buy everything that you want if you do n't have a job your parents should pay for everything and i think that if you want be an adult a good person you must be independent from your parents i have worked since i was twelve years old and in my opinion it is very important to work
ok when you travel by airplane you have to know that you must go to the airport by car bus or train after arriving at the airport you must know that you have to do a check in and after the check in you pass a control by the police and you must have your documents
i think that the students can use the new technologies to study better using computers using mobile phones because they can look up everything on their mobiles
working on group projects can be a good solution for doing things best every person can teach you to do new things
in my opinion it 's bad because you do n't focus on the text i prefer to read a paragraph on my own and try to think about the text
the university has to try to ensure that every student learns well and does his course well
i 'm very interested in the environment for example i am very curious about environmental problems so to sustain the world is a basic problem for us so it is very important
my brother is most similar to me he has two points in common with me he is gentle and often makes a joke in daily life but he 's not good at studying
i agree that schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes there are two reasons and if they do not exercise they will put on weight and will become sick in the future they ca n't concentrate on studying for a short time so it is good for schools to give fitness classes
hi first bees collect nectar from flowers and that is brought back to their nest and there is a lot of honey in the nest and second beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives it is dangerous work but it 's essential for the honey company and then in the factory honey is put into bottles and those are sent to a truck and the truck transports the bottles to the store somewhere
when students choose a country to study in abroad first they should think about how to study and what is the aim of studying so thinking about that they can choose the country that is the best for studying
so other countries have different culture so they may have difficulty understanding each other and other students
so they can communicate with a lot of people in another country
it 's not difficult to become independent so that is their aim
of course i live in a flat near to the coast and we have the sea five minutes away approximately we live in a flat amongst neighbours
i enjoy visiting museums and monuments
i enjoy spending time with my granddad because when i was child i went with him everywhere
i would like to be a professional psychologist and work in a hospital with patients with mental health issues
well there are many advantages but also there are disadvantages for example the advantages are that the students who work know the effort that it takes to pay their universities and this is a positive point but a disadvantage for example is that they ca n't dedicate all the time to study and their marks can be worse in my opinion it depends on the person for example for one person it 's good but for another person it 's bad that 's what i think
well to travel by plane you have to travel to the airport you can go by bus by car or by train and then when you are in the airport you have to do the check in for the check in you have to show your passport and an assistant will do the issuing then you have to go to the document control then the security then you wait for the plane because it is recommended to arrive two hours before the departure time and then when the information board tells you you have to board the plane
nowadays we have technology to support our studies
well in fact there are many many positive things
i think attending lectures is better because you have another opinion you can ask about any doubts and you hear different options
well nowadays we are living in the media age and i think it 's positive to have a lot of ways to improve and learn things at university
my favourite time of year is summer there is a lot of sun the weather is warm and i like it
it is important to me to read and listen to the news but sometimes the news is not good because there are a lot of problems in the world or a lot of bad news so i prefer not to read and listen to the news
when i was a child i spent my free time with my friends in the park we played some games and we played with other children in the park
in the future i hope i work in a big company and i work with a lot of people in a business in the area of business administration
well i think it is important that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience because there are a lot of advantages like you improve your personal life and your job in my opinion there are no disadvantages to this well maybe you do n't have more time more free time to do other things and well in my own opinion i think it is important for students to have practical work experience during their university courses
well this line graph shows the visits to three new online pop music sites during their first week as you can see tunes net increases dramatically from day one to day seven then songs for you is not very popular
that is good for the team
well it is not necessary to have face to face teams for the team to work i recommend having face to face teams because it is more efficient when the people see each other in person
well i lived in galicia and now i am living in salamanca
well when i am on holiday i like spend my time for example going to the beach and also going running also having dinner at good restaurants so
well i like spending my time with my mum or with my grandmother because i love spending time with her she tells me stories about when she was young and is very funny
well in the future i would like to be a teacher with my own school i like children and i like school
well nowadays it is very common for students to get jobs to pay for their university studies but it is difficult because this has advantages and disadvantages for example one advantage could be they have money for buying their own things and they can spend the money on their things but it has a disadvantage also for example they have to combine the job and studying and in some cases it is very difficult to combine these also they have n't any free time and so it 's difficult for a young person
yeah i agree with you
yeah i think attending lectures is best or is better than reading alone because you can learn from the mistakes of other people and you also practice your pronunciation and you learn to read well
firstly the other culture is a very important part to interest me secondly i will make new friends in the other country
when i am free i often play computer games with my classmates it 's a very interesting thing when i play them i feel excited and forget any troubles
i hope to live in the south of china because it has a developed economy and the culture is very free there the environment is also good to live in
secondly they will have strong bodies from their fitness classes the advantages can include the following
hello everyone today my presentation topic is about how honey is produced and i will show everyone a diagram firstly you can see the bees will collect nectar from flowers and they will take it to their house we call it a beehive and we can buy their honey yeah in the supermarket it is a really delicious thing i think
the students choosing a country should consider the culture of the country because the culture is a very important point
studying a second language can help people to make friends with people from other countries and they can also discuss complex questions with their teacher
firstly they will feel it is difficult to make friends with people from other countries because of the difference in culture
i agree with that because students learning in another country they need to do things by themselves
i am super interested in learning about other countries because it 's really necessary in our life to have knowledge of other cultures
i like to gather with my friends and drink some beers or maybe go to concerts with them and i really love to read too
the best way for me is watching some videos cartoons or listening to music and trying to think in english
i like to sew because it permits me to fabricate my own clothes so it 's really fun
i think that the life of students is great fun because normally they meet new people and they are very young so they love to party but in my opinion i think that the two things are good but always in a balanced way
acid rain is caused by the factories and vehicles that expel pollution into the air then acid particles are in smoke and they are blown to many parts of the atmosphere then the acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles fall as dust and they come to the earth other particles acid particles mix with cloud water and then the acid particles are in rain or snow and then they fall on the fields and damage our environment
i advise them to eat a lot of proteins and follow a mediterranean diet because it 's the healthiest and it 's necessary for our health
i do n't think that it 's necessary to do exercise every day but for example doing it three times per week is good and walk also
i think that sleep is so very important for our body and having good habits and sleeping eight hours per night is sufficient
it depends on the use of the technology in many cases it 's good for our health because it helps us
it 's very very very very very very good
this is my opinion
to travel by plane first you go to the airport and check in and you must pass document control and security and you can have something to eat while you wait in the airport until the plane is in the airport it is very very important that you pass the document control because it is necessary
technology it 's very very important for students because now at this time everybody uses technology to look for answers
i think it is very good because the students can ask all the questions that they have then at that moment
my favourite time is autumn because autumn is a very comfortable season in this season it 's not very hot nor very cold and the fruits are very delicious in autumn
i think reading the news every day is very important we need to understand what is happening in our surroundings every day and it 's most important that we prepare everything in advance
when i was a child i did n't have much work or studying i needed to do i just needed to have fun
my master 's degree is environmental management so maybe in the future i will choose a job related to my major and i think the environment is very important in our daily life and this career is very useful
i think this topic has both advantages and disadvantages speaking of advantages maybe university students can get more work experience through the practical work process but students would n't have too much time to work in the university and for students in the university maybe the most important task is study they need to focus on their classes to get more professional knowledge about their major so maybe sometimes they ca n't balance the time for study and working so i think maybe some university classes can include some practical work experience but not all of them
this graph gives some information about the numbers of people visiting the sites during their first week online and there are three online pop music sites the red one is tunes net and the blue one is music now the yellow one is songs for you and in this diagram we can see that the red one tunes net increased in these seven dasy and the blue and yellow ones that 's music now and songs for you went down in these four days
i think the most important factor is to have patience because we need to cooperate with everyone in this team so we need to have patience to work with others and listen to others ' requirements and answer their questions
i think in a small team maybe we do n't have many people we can talk to so maybe we ca n't come up with many interesting ideas or listen to many other opinions these are disadvantages in a small team
yes maybe face to face is more effective than meeting online so maybe online is more effective than the face to face form
maybe teamwork has better results than working alone because in a team we have many people so maybe sometimes we can get more information and creative interesting ideas in a team
well to be honest i have to say that i 'm not really interested in the environment that 's probably due to the fact that i 'm afraid of all the animals and so i 'm not really into that kind of thing
we are really into hanging out but also we absolutely love staying at home and watching a movie or t v series while eating some pizza and drinking beer or coca cola
that 's a nice question i mean i can not decide which person of my family is more similar to me that 's probably due to the fact that i am similar in different ways to different people in my family
doing some sport at school is really important in italy every school has at least one hour of gym at school obviously the advantages are related to our health and the disadvantages are related to the fact that some people agree that sport is n't as important as culture math and so on as far as i 'm concerned it 's important to have some sports classes at school because it also help students to wind down to stop thinking for at least one hour and to relax more if sport is relaxing at all
so then the precious honey will be sold to people to be eaten with milk and so on
to make up their mind about the country to go to they should consider the fact that they have to speak with other people in that country so they have to learn that language and also maybe attend a course to learn that language better
well there are plenty of advantages to knowing another language first of all it could be really useful for your future working life in fact for example it is really a bonus when you have another language on your c v
well there are a great number of difficulties that students can find for example the fact that you have to talk to other people so at the beginning it will be really difficult to understand them and to approach them
well i 'd say that the best way is to interact with people from that country obviously spending time with them can help you to learn about their habits and also about their country also their eating habits
i 'd say so yeah absolutely as living in another country will help you to become much more independent because you can not count on your family and you will have to do everything alone
i am very interested because you can learn about their cultures and what people are like and i think it 's important
in my free time i like doing some exercise i like watching t v shows listening to music or maybe reading books because i love it
well i reckon that the advantage would be that you can earn money and you can pay for your studies you can develop some skills that could help you in the future and maybe you can put that work on your c v the main disadvantage could be that you ca n't spend your time studying i mean you have less time to study or do homework well i think that it could be a good idea to work
and because of that many particles and toxins have been liberated into the atmosphere and this is very bad for the environment because some of these particles and toxins mix with cloud water and others can fall as dust but those that mix with cloud water then fall in rain
first of all you need to know that this is good for you and think about it like a fun activity
because our body is made of water we need to drink water for ourselves and this is good because we feel healthier
negative effect because this is stressful for us and means that no one moves and goes out to the street
very much interested in learning about other countries ' cultures after graduating high school in japan i moved to the u k spent one year there then went to an irish university for four years now i 'm in the u s so i 've learnt a lot about different cultures
i spend most of my free time with my family i 've got a son and daughter so i spend most of time with them playing drawing chatting watching t v together playing games together
when i was in japan and did not have many opportunities to speak the best thing to do was shadowing meaning listening to the radio and speaking after that
i would like to learn how to cut and cook fish because now i 've started fishing as a new hobby and if you can you know cut and cook fish it 's great
i do not agree with the statement that all university students should do part time jobs there is an advantage of doing a part time job as a student obviously you can learn how to earn money and obviously as a student you need to spend a lot of money on tuition fees and your daily life but on the other hand you have to balance your time you have to study in the library if you 're a student the main thing you 've got to do is studying so if you have enough money and your focus is on studying a subject you do not have to do a part time job so this is the reason why i do not agree with the statement
so here 's how acid rain is caused and eventually damages the environment first of all acid particles are created via emission of pollution from factories and vehicles and other sources and then acid particles in smoke go up in the air and in thr air acid particles are carried by wind and form clouds some acid falls directly to the ground and damages the soil or ponds rivers and oceans
i think a good eating habit is eating breakfast lunch and dinner at the same time every day and not eating too many sweets or drinking alcohol
i think it is extremely important to drink water regularly instead of drinking only coffee or alcohol and sugary beverages because it dehydrates your body
it 's not essential to do exercise every single day but it is important to do some exercise it depends on your age your gender and what level of health you 're looking for but certainly doing exercise is good for you
i do not necessarily agree that every single person needs eight hours of sleep every day on average it would be good to have eight hours ' sleep but again depending on the person you may only need six hours
i see the environment as a pretty serious issue coz nowadays people tend to create a lot of waste so normally when i go out i bring my own bottle my own container for food et cetera
me and my friends enjoy going window shopping finding nice restaurants for supper and as well going to a cinema to enjoy a movie
in my family i 'm most similar to my mother she is the one who always takes care of me and pays all my tuition fees for the school and she always takes me out when she has some event
i 'm currently living in taipei because of the work i used to do here
there are some pros and cons if schools and colleges make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes the negative points the disadvantages are the students may get too tired after the exercises and they will become very sweaty so that the classroom will fill with bad smells on the other hand the advantages are the students may be able to keep fit and to be more able to focus on what they are learning coz there 's a study saying that exercise can help people to get focused and they will become effective learners
today 's presentation is about how honey is produced there are six steps for this and it goes from the flower to the shop so first of all the bees have to collect nectar from the flowers after that they will make honey from nectar in beehives after they make the honey the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then put it into jars after that the jars will be shipped to the supermarkets or the stores that sell the honey and in the end the customers will get the honey from the supermarket
when choosing a country to study in students should consider the culture first whether it suits their preferences and secondly it 's the weather
students may find the culture difficult when they study in another country because different countries have different cultures it might be extremely different from their home country so they need time to adapt
students can learn about the local culture by making some local friends in the country this way they can all hang out together so that they can experience the local culture
i think studying abroad indeed helps students to become more independent as for me i studied abroad for a year and that made me more independent because i had to do everything on my own including cooking
i love learning about new countries new languages new cultures because i think that the more you know about new societies different societies and new ways of thinking the better person you can become
i used to have a dog and then i used to love taking him to parks or for walks he passed away and nowadays i like to read and watch t v series and movies
practicing especially with a demanding teacher who corrects me all the time and helps me improve my pronunciation and grammar and going to school and studying studying and studying
it would be dancing because i think it 's a great job it 's relaxing and it would also improve my self confidence
all university students should do part time jobs while they 're studying in my opinion this should be optional for the students because on the one hand the ones who do n't work would have the opportunity to check out how real life works and put into practice the theory they learn in class on the other hand for those who are already working to support themselves or to support their families it would be a great disadvantage because they would n't be able to leave their real jobs and look for something that may not be rewarding in terms of money i 've been through this situation and it was really exhausting most teachers do n't understand that you do have to work to support yourself
all the pollution caused by vehicles and factories is what causes acid rain so the government should be more demanding with factories in order to avoid this problem
first of all i think people should cut down on sugar salt and processed food and as a vegetarian i would also suggest people totally cut out or reduce red meat as much as possible
it is extremely important if you respect your body remember two litres may be too much for a person who weighs fifty kilos but may be too little for a person who weighs a hundred kilos so you should always talk to a doctor
i think it is essential to do exercise and the question about doing it every day depends on a person 's habits
well i personally disagree because i need nine hours of sleep but some people do well on seven hours
this is a tricky question because it depends on how people deal with technology on the one hand it can be good because you can research good ways better ways of life but on the other hand it can be bad because people are spending too much time in front of screens
currently i live in london which is the largest city in the united kingdom it is very beautiful but it 's really noisy as well
i have several of them but my favourite is taking photos and editing them
i really enjoy spending time with my sister she is younger than me and she is amazing she is not only very funny she 's also very intelligent and really amazing
so i would like to do something related to fashion such as be a visual merchandiser or designer
so basically i strongly believe that to get a job to earn some money to invest in paying for your university studies is a very good idea the advantage is that you are going to be independent financially independent of your parents and the disadvantage could be that you wo n't have a lot of time to have a great time with your friends and also maybe you wo n't have a lot of time to study however my opinion is that if you want to have a very good future you need to do that so i strongly believe that is a very good idea
basically first of all you need to arrive at the airport so you must take a car bus or train the best option is a train because it 's very fast in addition when you arrive at the airport you need to do the check in so you must take your passport with you then you need to go to the document control and you need to show your passport and your ticket then you need to pass through the security control and then you need to wait until the hour of departure then you need board and then the plane is going to take off
when students are working on group projects together they are learning to be good at teamwork which is a very important skill
i live in a tiny village it 's a rural village and it 's surrounded by beautiful landscapes and stunning views it 's quite breathtaking
on holiday i like to travel to different countries to discover and explore foreign cultures because i 'm an open minded person
i like to spend time my free time with my sister because she is the same age as me and we like to enjoy afternoons playing football in the garden
in the future i would like to have a job related to my degree as an engineer of industrial technology
in my opinion i strongly believe that not all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies because there are some students that can afford their university studies the main advantage is they earn money but the drawback is the time that they spend working at their job
this diagram shows the stages people need to go through to travel by airplane before landing you must check in with your documents and you pass the security control next you have some time to wait in the airport doing some shopping or going to the toilet or a cafe when it is time you board the plane and then finally you take off
yes i reckon that face to face is the best way to learn but nowadays technology has improved and allows students to study online
in my opinion i do n't think that attending lectures is better than reading alone because reading alone you improve yourself
it 's so important for universities to have learning facilities because some of the students in the university have part time jobs and they do n't have enough time to go to a classroom
the place where i live is called murcia it 's a region of the south of spain
on my holiday i love to travel
in the family my father is the best person to be with in your free time and to spend your time with because he is so funny and it 's so exciting to be with him
in the future i 'd like to be a professor in a great university in spain because i like chemistry and i studied chemistry and it would be a dream to be a professor of chemistry
nowadays having a part time job when you are studying at university is more common this has advantages and disadvantages one of the advantages is the experience of being part of a team but one disadvantage is that it is complicated to coordinate your university studies and the part time job my opinion this is so important and you need to do this work
well travel is one of the first things i want to do first you have to go to the airport it is so important to be on time so you have to choose the best option to arrive at the airport
nowadays technology is more important in life so this is the key the first key to improve your knowledge
my opinion is the best way to improve your knowledge is have a teacher face to face with you
you can always learn about others
i prefer reading alone but other people prefer attending lectures because it 's a way to be focused and is more effective for them
in my free time i like watching t v reading playing with my son doing sport but my favourite hobby is photography i love photography
in my opinion the best way to improve my english is speaking with english people or watching movies or t v in english
i would like to play the guitar or any instrument i think it 's very beautiful
this is a very interesting topic personally i think the advantages are the students will be more responsible and they will learn a job and the disadvantage i think is the students will have less time for studying but in my opinion i think there are more advantages than disadvantages
i 'm going to speak about acid rain first of all the factories are working and the pollution has a lot of acid particles and smoke in it and these acid particles are carried by the wind
the best way to eat healthily is do n't eat fast food
i think people have drink eight quarter litre glasses a day ok two liters
i do n't think it 's necessary to exercise every day i think it 's better twice a week
in my opinion that 's great to sleep eight hours a day
and also for me the food of the country is very important
i enjoy spending my free time in the cinema for example with my friends or going to the beach with my family or walking with my dogs
i think that the best way to improve my english is to go to another country where they speak english and spend a long time there and work in this country
i could learn i do n't know i think i would be very happy if i could fly
on the one hand one advantage is that the students can earn money it is the best part for you can spend the money on your university fees or on other courses or other things
acid rain begins to form when moisture in the air combines with acid particles emitted by factories and vehicles after the acid particles are carried by the wind the acid particles mix with the cloud water and precipitate in rain or snow form it depends and this does much damage to the environment because the pollution in these particles is very very bad and corrosive for all the planet
in my opinion having good eating habits is very important for improving your health
i think that drinking water is very important because water is used to clean your body and the experts recommend drinking two litres a day
in my opinion exercising is essential to having a good quality of life it may not be necessary to practice it every day although if you have the time and want to that is fine
i believe that children have to sleep more than adults but for a teenager or an adult it is appropriate to sleep eight hours a day
i think it has its pros and cons but for me the advantages are more important since thanks to technology a great advance has been made through history and that helps us improve our quality of life
yes i love the environment so much and i can find many students walking around the campus
me and my friends enjoy watching movies together so that we can discuss the heroes and heroines and we can talk about the scenes in the movies
i am most similar to my older sister because our height is about the same and also our appearance is about the same we wear glasses
in the future i would like to live in a rural area because in a rural area there is less air pollution because there are fewer cars and less transportation and in a rural area it is more peaceful and it 's quieter
fitness classes in the school day may bring advantages or disadvantages to the students and then the other advantage for students who join the fitness class is that they may learn different exercises in the fitness classes however there are some disadvantages where the student may not focus on their class and then this will cause them to have less time to do their studying
the diagram shows how honey is produced from the flower to the shop first the bees will collect the nectar from the flowers and then the bees will make the honey from nectar that they collected in their beehives after that the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then the honey will be processed and packaged into the containers which normally will be jars after the honey is well packaged the honey will be sent or delivered to the shop
when the students are choosing a country for study they must consider the cost of learning and also the cost of living because if the cost of living is very high their parents may not be able to afford to pay for it
the advantage of studying in the second language is that the students may have more advantages in getting a new job in the future because they know like more than one language
when studying in another country i think that the student may face some difficulties such as they may not be able to communicate well with the local people because of the language
when the student is studying in another country i think the student can learn about the local culture by joining in with the activities of the local people
yes i agree that students studying abroad can become independent because when they are in another country they may have to adapt to the environment and stuff and if they have any troubles they have to solve them on their own
my favourite time of the year is the winter because i like to feel the cold on my face and i love winter clothes
i like to be informed of what is happening around me that 's why i usually watch the news every day i think it 's very important to know how your country is doing
i come from a large family so i used to spend my free time playing with my brothers and sisters on the weekend we used to go to our house in the village
in the future i would like to have enough money to travel with my family around the world i would love to visit a different country every year
starting work before you finish your studies is an opportunity to improve your skills and to be in contact with the real world maybe spending your study time working will be bad for you because you spend your time working not studying in my opinion it 's a very good idea because i think it 's important to be in contact with the working world
in the picture we can see the progress of three new online pop music sites we can see that music now rose from the first day till the third day
sometimes it 's good to be in disagreement because you can improve your ideas and maybe it will make you better
it 's possible that there are people who do n't like working in a team
i am very interested in learning about other countries and i try to know more about them
well i enjoy going for a walk with my family reading or watching movies and especially t v series i like studying english practicing it in different ways
the best way for me to improve my english is practicing it practicing speaking with somebody watching movies and reading
if you mean a new skill which is something absolutely new for me i would try a new kind of sport
well the advantages for university students when they do part time jobs are obvious students learn how to communicate with other people and how to work in a team for example also they have their pocket money maybe not just pocket money and they are able to pay back their student loan there are also some disadvantages though these are inability to have much free time for entertainment difficulties finding enough time to study and maybe tiredness my own opinion is it 's very good when students can work
there is a big problem for nature with acid rain there is a natural cycle causing this phenomenon vehicles and factories and also planes and other means of transport make a lot of fumes which go into the atmosphere they form pollution which consists of acid particles with the smoke acid particles go into the atmosphere carried by the wind and some of them are going down to the ground as dust rain or snow
i would recommend eating more fruits and vegetables and also food rich in carbohydrates and proteins and all food should be fresh
i think that drinking lots of water is very important for everybody because our body consists mainly of water and all processes in our body are unable to be without water
i think it 's essential to do exercises every day because in this way a person can keep fit and be in good condition
well i agree with the opinion that people have to sleep at least eight hours a day not less but maybe some peoplr need more sleep
technology may have positive and negative effects and it depends on different circumstances when finding information is an important thing it 's preferable to use a computer but not too much
it 's a beautiful city surrounded by mountains on one side and the ocean on the other side i can see the sunset and the sunrise every day from my home i feel like i really like it living in this place almost all year it 's sunny and very nice
i love to go around and ride a bicycle go hiking running around the parks looking at nature with my family that is the thing i most like to do
i 'd like to have a job where i can use all my abilities and skills i would prefer a job in an office where i can sit from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon so after that i could have some quality time with my family doing things together maybe eating food together
we are going to talk about if students should get jobs while they are doing their university studies we know that everybody is going to get jobs because of the money the money is always good to have but consider that the time you have to spend working is the time you will take out from the university classes and i think you should be focusing especially when you are at school where you have a lot more freedom on what is important and what is important in that time is that you have to sit and listen to your teachers and learn and go deep and research investigate not only focus on the money in that short period of time
hello today i 'm going to teach you how to travel by airplane to be able to take an airplane first you need to take transportation to get to the place called the airport the airport is the place where the airplanes leave from when you are at the airport you need to go and do the check in with an assistant after the assistant has checked that you have the right place then you need to pass on to the document control where the policeman is going to ask you about your passport to check that you have the right name on it after that then you have to wait to be called to board the airplane one by one
to study more effectively students can use the technology of their smartphones for example there they can use calendars where they can write down all they have to do during the day the week and the month
a face to face class is the same as having an online class because with the use of the new technologies you can talk directly to your teacher through your computer so for me it does n't make any difference doing it face to face or having online classes
also you can ask your partner about a question that maybe you did n't hear before and you can get help from them with the organisation of the work
he can explain a little bit more then it 's easier to understand maybe you can raise your hand and ask a question
facilities provided by the university are basic nowadays because with the use of technology we can improve our research for example if you need to buy a book or you need to read about some interesting topic then you can go and sit at the computer and get it right away
i am very interested in the environment and also i am worried because people use a lot of plastics and we are n't concerned about this
well we love to go to the cinema in summer go to the beach but the summer is a little different but we love to go out together and go running or do other sports this is all
maybe physically it 's my mother but in personality probably my brother or my father because my father is more relaxed and more independent and me too
well in my opinion the advantage of doing fitness classes in school time is that all students can practice a sport and so they are healthier and the disadvantage is that in school they need to reduce their time on other subjects maybe maths or maybe languages or i do n't know but they need to reduce another subject in my opinion it 's a good idea because children and teenagers usually do n't practise sport and it 's very important for their health so it 's a good idea
in the picture i can see a diagram about honey and how honey comes from flowers and goes to the shop well first bees collect nectar from the flowers and they make honey from nectar in the beehives later the beekeepers who are the people who collect the honey collect the honey and put it in a jar
i imagine they will consider the language of the country the universities that there are in the country and the culture
the main advantage of studying in a second language is that you can improve your language skills maybe if it is english you can improve your english and you can meet people in this country
the most obvious difficulty is if you are in a country that does n't speak your language you need to speak in its language so this is difficult
speak with local people go to concerts and festivals go to the cinema and watch films in this language
yes i agree with this because when you travel alone and live alone in a different country you need to do things alone
my favourite time of year is christmas
for me it 's not important to read or listen to the news
i spent my free time when i was child riding my bike
i would like to be a manager in the future
i would like to start by giving the advantage in my opinion these kinds of measures ensure that the students acquire the skills that they will need in their future work in my opinion there must be a compromise between study time and practical work time for getting the best from the work
we can see from the first day all of them started and maintained the same number of visits the most successful was music now which started with around seventy visits on the first day and increased its visits to one hundred and ten on the third day maintaining this high number of visits for three days and then it fell down to eighty visits on the seventh day with songs four you we see the opposite of that success because it started with a similar number to music now only a few visits less than music now around sixty per day maintaining this number for five days until the big fall on the sixth and the seventh days
if the leader is honest everyone works really well
i do n't agree with this because the team leader must be encouraged if they are encouraged the team will follow them wherever they go
i think not because some things at the moment are working remotely and this is perfect for some kind of jobs because not everyone needs to be together to do work well
it depends because some tasks are better if only one person does it if this person knows exactly how to do it it 's perfect for one person only
my favourite time of the year it is maybe when summer arrives in the town and i love to go to the beach i love summer clothes like to put on a dress
it 's necessary to know what is going on in your city and your country
i used to spend my time in my neighbourhood with the other children and we played games like football or something
i hope i will be working on something related to human resources that gives me time to travel and maybe buy a camper and see spain
it also enables a student to develop their skills on the other hand we have the disadvantage it could be that the internship is not well paid in my own opinion i think it 's a good idea to be a trainee in some company and learn about real problems and also work in a team and have a boss who shows you how to do things
the past week three new online pop music sites were launched in this graph we can see that music now is the online pop music site that had the highest increase in visitors in the week followed by songs four you
for me a good team leader should be empathic with other people always be ready to fix any problem quickly and keep the team united to have one direction
working with small teams has problems like people get overwhelmed by the amount of work maybe they do n't get along with their companions and also they can get tired of always doing the same task
absolutely but it is good to express your ideas and knowing each other is essential to working in a team
no totally but i think it 's better face to face than for example by email or video conference and that 's because you can misunderstand with those ways and that 's why i prefer face to face
from my point of view i agree with these people who think that there are better results working in a team that 's because everyone has faults maybe in a team there is someone who can fill in with other skills
it is located in the north of china and it 's also a coastal city with beautiful scenery there are many beautiful beaches in my hometown if you 've got time you have to go there and relax
i enjoy playing video games with my buddies and when it is sunny we often have a barbecue in a park and then go to a nightclub if it is rainy we often watch movies at home like couch potatoes
it should be my mom because my mom is a mathematics teacher and i 'm very interested in math so we often study together and when i 'm in a bad mood she often helps me too and gives me comfort so i appreciate her most
it would be good to become a maths teacher because i 'm very interested in math and i am more than interested to talk with others about math and i really enjoy the satisfaction that teaching brings me
what 's more it can help them to improve their communication skills it helps them to learn how to communicate with the people around them but the disadvantage is that maybe a part time job will take so much of their time that they wo n't concentrate on their studies so in my opinion university students should balance their time between part time jobs and their studies
here is an illustration about how to travel by plane first travel to the airport by bus by taxi or by train and after you arrive at the airport you have to check in make sure you have all your i d cards certificates visa and so on after that then you have to have your documents checked if you 've finished these steps then you will have a security check and then you have to wait for a while after that when your flight is going to take off you got ta board and then just enjoy your flight
by surfing some educational websites students can acquire a lot of useful educational information and it can help them enhance their educational skills and help them to get a high score
i agree with that when you have lessons face to face with teachers you will be more focused on your studies and you might like to communicate with your teachers about some questions they can help you easily any time
it can help them to develop cooperative skills and communicative skills and organisational skills
i think attending lectures would be better because the professor and advisor will help to point out your further study direction and they can help you to reduce the stress of study or something
modern learning facilities could bring advanced knowledge around the world and students can use them for relaxation or for getting some useful information from the internet so i think it 's very important
i believe that learning about other countries and their culture is very important since i am a teacher i consider it to be really important because in this way you know the people and how they work
most of my free time i spend with my family with my wife my son and sometimes my parents we likee to have a nice night drinking beer and maybe eating some pizza
from my perspective the best way to improve your english is to use it in a real way for example speaking with people whose first language is english i also like to use speak and improve
i do n't consider myself a good speaker in front of people
having a part time job during your university studies can bring some advantages and some disadvantages a disadvantage could be that you can have less time to do your homework for example an advantage could be that if your part time job is related to your career then it will help you because you will apply what you are learning in the university and if it does n't work you can learn from that experience so in my opinion it 's very important for students to have a part time job however this part time job must be related to their bachelor 's degrees so they will learn more
it is well known that rain is a natural phenomenon however factories and vehicles produce pollution and this pollution is mainly acid particles in smoke and these particles are carried by the wind and some particles fall as dust on the other hand there 're other particles that mix with the clouds and these clouds producing water or snow make these acid particles fall on the trees on the animals even on our cars and this can be harmful and it damages nature
since our bodies are made up of ninety six percent water it 's very important that we drink water however as you said before drinking lots of water can be very harmful
maybe doing exercise every day can be excessive if you are a beginner in this field however maybe three days per week can be very effective if you want to have a healthy life and then you can go on and work harder
from my own perspective i consider that it depends on the person i sleep eight hours and that 's enough for me however there are other people who need ten hours and there are other people who need just six hours and they are done
i consider that technology indeed affects us however i believe that it will affect you more the more you use it
the place where i live it 's really quiet with surrounding villages and you have the possibility to go to the centre of the city but you do n't live there
well i enjoy travelling that 's the best activity that i can do when i am on holiday
i enjoy spending time with my sister because we can do a lot of physical activities and well we have the same interests
in the future i would like to work as a teacher because i 'm studying to be teacher and i 'd really like to be teacher in public education in spain
well i think university students want to pay for their own studies because it 's really difficult for families to get the amount of the money that you need to pay for your studies so the advantage is well you are independent of your family and are financially independent the disadvantage is obviously you have less time to study so that 's not good for your degree in my opinion it 's more important the independence and not to be a burden on your family so you need to have a job and be able to pay for your own studies
first of all you have to travel to the airport so you could do this journey by train on a bus or by car well when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and show your documentation because it 's necessary to leave the country well you have to to pass the security control and then you have to wait
they are tools too
it depends because on some occasions when you attend lectures you learn a lot because the teacher is good at his job but on other occasions attending lectures is not effective because it 's the same as reading alone
it 's important because the way that the students learn is changing all the time so that 's important to modernise your style of teaching to be attractive for the students
i am interested in learning about foreign cultures
i enjoy my free time playing baseball or travelling
i think the best way to improve my english skills is to communicate with foreign people in english
one of the advantages of doing part time jobs is you learn about society but one of the disadvantages is you have less time to study at university so i think all university students should do part time jobs
first the smoke of pollution is emitted by vehicles and factories then the acid particles which are in the smoke are carried by wind then some acid particles fall as dust on the ground and other acid particles mix with cloud water then acid particles are in rain or snow and fall to the ground then they damage the environment
you can eat breakfast because it 's the best it 's the most important meal
it is important to drink water because drinking water makes us so healthy
i think it is important to do exercise every day because doing exercise makes me so healthy and ok
i live in gran canaria a fantastic island with some of the best weather in the world here besides beaches we have fantastic mountains and people here are wonderful
when i 'm on holiday for me it 's essential to relax but always when i can i love to travel and discover new places in the world with my family and friend
of all my family i think the person who i have the best time with is my mother because we are pretty similar in the way that we speak
i would like to work in reception so for this i 'm learning languages because it 's essential for this type of work and a good thing about this work is you meet people from all over the world
not all students have enough money to pay for their needs during university one advantage of getting a job is that they can have enough money to buy the things they need throughout the course they do n't have to worry about how to make ends meet on the other hand one disadvantage could be that they do n't have the same amount of time to study as other students that do n't need a job
to go to the airport you have to choose one option you can go by car by bus or by train when you arrive at the airport do n't forget to do the check in at the main desk after that you can pass the document control and the security control after all this you can wait in the hall there you can find toilets and shops and you can eat because there is a wide variety of restaurants when you see on the board the time of your flight you board the airplane and here we go you can fly
if there is a lot of webspace where you can find a free course
from from my point of view it 's a good way a really good way but it 's not the only way if you have english friends for instance you can speak with them and that 's really good too
i think working in a group is a good option because every member of the group can help each other and they can collaborate between themselves
i do n't know i 'm not really sure but i think that reading is very good for improving your vocabulary and your writing
i believe they 're very important because if you have a lot of facilities for the students they can choose the best way to learn and improve their language
yes of course i mean i live in a neighborhood near to the city centre and here we can find everything shops blah blah blah blah blah
when i 'm on holiday i love to travel with my family if we can to foreign countries and visit museums eat in different restaurants
i most enjoy spending time with my mother because she is very funny and she always has lots of stories to tell me about my infancy about my teenage years so i have a good time with her
in the future i would like to be a teacher an english teacher because i love being with young people and i love teaching languages to anyone that 's what i do
do n't you see that students should get jobs to pay for their university studies i absolutely agree that this has a lot of advantages for students by getting a job they can experience what a real job is and that practice will help them to choose a good job for the future it could also have some disadvantages so having a job while you 're studying can take time away from studying so you may have less free time so you can know what the working life is like
this diagram shows the steps you have to follow when travelling by plane first of all you have to travel to the airport you can do it by bus by train or by car and when you arrive at the airport you have to do the check in pass through the document control and pass through the security control finally you do the boarding then you are on the plane and then you only have to wait till the plane takes off
i think there are lots of options for students to use technology to study more effectively they can be gadgets computer programs mobile phones social networks
you can also see how his body moves
i think the most important thing that they can learn in group projects is communication communication is very important in all types of jobs so it could be a good thing for them to learn that 's what i think
i think that attending lectures can be more effective than reading alone because you have to pay more attention to the person who is doing the lecture so i think that concentration will help you a lot
i think it is very important for universities to provide learning facilities for students i think that 's very important
when i meet up with my friends we like to go to the beach go to movies or go to eat at some restaurant
when i graduate i would like to move to the united states because the job opportunities are better than in mexico
the disadvantage is the cost i think
bees are one of the most important animals for human existence and also they produce the honey that is a product that humans consume first the bees collect nectar from flowers then they make honey from nectar in beehives and people that are in charge of collecting the honey from beehives are the beekeepers and then they sell it to the stores for human consumption
i think the most important thing to consider is the country where you can develop professionally and you can learn about your career
i think that there are many advantages of learning a second a third a fourth language because it 's important for the development of your career and yourself as a person
i think the most difficult thing is being far away from your country
there are many ways to learn about other countries but the best way is making friends that are from there
i think that it could be possible but also can depend on the students and their habits
there are a lot of things to see and do
two or three years ago when i was on holiday i always tried to travel my favourite place is the north of spain but right now with the coronavirus it 's impossible to travel anywhere so i 'm all the time in my house
i spend most time always with my daughter because she is not going to school because of the coronavirus at the moment so she is with me twenty four hours a day we go everywhere together
right now i am studying for a position to work for the government so for me the perfect work would be that i want to work for the government to have stability and a good schedule working only in the mornings
the advantage could be that the job gives them a chance to put into practice skills they have learned in school the part time jobs have disadvantages because the students could feel tired and may not have enough time to study while doing part time work in my opinion it 's necessary to keep in mind the importance of a good balance between school work and part time jobs i 'd rather study first and then work only in the vacation in summer
in the diagram i can see how you have to go to the airport to travel by airplane the first thing is to travel to the airport taking a bus or train or in a car there you can park the car or you can get off the bus and go to the entrance later you have to check in your luggage or if you have hand luggage it 's not necessary to check it in then later you have to pass the document control with the police and the security later you have to wait
the use of technological tools motivates and makes it easier for students to focus their attention to be more effective there could be more entertaining learning technology
i think face to face is better than online classes because when you are with a teacher in front on you it 's better the concentration and you can learn better
they could divide the projects for example if there are three people they can do each do a part
in my opinion it 's better reading alone than attending lectures with other people because when you are alone the concentration is bigger than in a group so for me it 's better to read alone
i really love to learn more about countries and specifically more about europe their culture about their food about their language about almost everything i think that it 's very interesting to know about their history
to be honest i do n't have like a lot of free time however if i have some hours or some minutes i spend it like making some cakes and also doing some exercise
the best way to improve my english is not by studying but by practicing speaking with other people and also watching series on netflix in english
if i could learn another skill maybe i would choose to learn french and german this is because the entire world well almost the entire world speaks those languages
as we know there are many students that also have a part time job part time jobs have advantages and disadvantages first the advantages we can see that people who have internships can make a few more mistakes than full time workers however as for the disadvantages the people who have a part time job are not very focused on the job or on their studies
the process begins with factories and vehicles spreading pollution then it is transformed into acid particles in smoke the wind carries some acid particles throughout the environment but some acid particles fall as dust however other acid particles mix with cloud water finally acid particles are in rain or snow this causes a lot of damage to the environment and it 's bad for our health
in my opinion it 's essential to go to a nutritionist they will give you a diet for your body and with this you can improve your eating habits
i think that a good way to drink more water is to have a big bottle and if you always carry it with you you will remember that you have to drink it
i think that it is not essential to do exercise every day but i recommend doing it often this is not because of your weight it is more about your health and good habits
i think that it depends on each person i would recommend like at least six hours per day but if you can sleep the essential amount for you it is ok
i think that it depends on whether you need technology
i am very interested in learning about other countries because i love travelling and getting to know other cultures and other people
in my free time i love to go out with my dog and well i love walking with him and i love reading books too on the sofa because it relaxes me a lot
i think that the best way to improve my english is to go abroad and practice with other people and i go to an english class twice a week to improve my english here
one thing that worries people is the money when they are studying it 's common that they do n't have enough money if they want to do a lot of things with their friends a lot of students have a part time job to do at the same time as their university studies it has a lot of advantages for example they have more money they can work abroad but the disadvantages are for example they do n't have enough time to study their degree
factories and vehicles produce pollution acid particles are in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wind some of these acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water and then these acid particles are in rain or snow to sum up acid rain damages the environment
i think that it 's important to eat healthily and do n't eat for example fast food and fatty food and increase the vegetables in your diet
i think it 's very important to drink water because we have to keep our body hydrated
i think that doing exercise is very important but it 's not possible every day so we have to do exercise about twice or three times a week
in my opinion technology is a bad way to relax because we have to disconnect in our free time
my favorite time of year is the summertime because i can enjoy my free time and i can enjoy my family
it is not very important because nowadays the news is bad and sad and i prefer to read a book or watch a series
i hope to be the best french teacher in a school i hope to do a project with my crafting skills
this question is very interesting because young people are prepared to work as soon as they finish their studies in this case it 's impossible because they are between twenty and twenty two years old for that reason this idea has so many advantages for young people and for companies and they can decide if they want to continue with this work or not
hello as you can see this graph shows how many people are visiting three new online pop music sites tunes net song four all and music now firstly you can see that on the first day there were more people visiting music now between sixteen and eighteen thousand people on the other days the music site music now was the winner reaching on the first and fifth day between a thousand and one thousand and twenty people visiting this site however on the seventh day there were more visitors for tunes net reaching a thousand people
ok a good team leader should be a person with character
yes i think each one can express their opinion of the project but this person must continue with a new idea
and in addition they can resolve problems that can appear
i think it is true because each one can have a different idea of how to do the project in the best way
this is a really small but cute town with a lot of young people there is also a beach and the weather is pretty good
in my spare time i enjoy going out with my friend and going to the fairground because i am a thrill seeker i also enjoy playing basketball since i 've been playing for ten years
i really enjoy spending time with my father because he is my best friend and we have a lot of things in common such as basketball and also eating and doing some shopping
my aim is to become a lawyer so i 'm working really hard for it because it 's been my dream since i was six so yeah i want to work in law
the main advantage of working during your studies to pay the university costs is the fact that that permits the student to have more responsibility and independence on the other hand a student can be less focused on their course and it can be a bad thing for their grades but as far as i 'm concerned working can be a good solution for students who ca n't afford the price of a great university nevertheless when a student has the choice i think that they should avoid working at the same time that they are studying
first of all you ca n't go to the airport on foot you need to take your car a bus or a train when you arrive at the airport you go to the check in and show your i d or your passport so people at the airport can verify your identity after that you pass a security guard and then you go to the waiting place there there are a lot of things you can do eat have a coffee and also buy some gifts for your family for example after that it is boarding time and you get on the airplane then your trip can start
they can use it for example instead of the time they would spend in library because it 's easy and real quick to find the information you need on the internet nowadays
as far as i 'm concerned you do n't need to be face to face and staring at people to learn for example today there is a virus and so everybody is in their own home and studying from there but the result is good too
everybody has to present his own point of view somehow
yeah sure because when you attend lectures you are in the mood you are in a good environment to learn and improve your skills
for me it 's not really important because what is important is the effort you put into your work every day because you need to improve you need to exercise
i live in madrid also it is a crowded city and i really enjoy its bustling streets and you can do many things there
i really enjoy going with my relatives to my mother 's village we all really get on well all together so we have a really good time there
i most enjoy spending time with my mother however sometimes we have to set aside our differences in order to improve our relationship
my dream job is to set up my own business a social one and be my own boss and contract employees in order to get a work life balance because currently i do n't have that
as i see it all university students should work part time or even full time in order to be able to support themselves or to be self sufficient so to sum up i have to say that as i see it working while studying is a good way to gain experience and also maybe in the future they will be able to have a better paid job than if they did n't work
when travelling by airplane people or travellers should first travel to the airport in their own way for example in their car or they can take an uber or a bus after that they need to get a boarding pass and pass the security control and if they pass this they will have to wait maybe for a long time and have lunch or go shopping after that they need to make a long queue in order to board and then they have a seat that is on their boarding pass and after the plane has taken off they need to turn off their devices and their mobile phone
and currently they have a wide range of possibilities and using technology for their study needs is a good choice they can search on the internet and they can share information with their colleagues
i 'm in totally agreement with that point of view since if you learn face to face with your teacher and also with other students you will be able to ask if you have any doubts also you can speak with your teacher
they can develop a wide range of skills such as communication skills social skills loyalty for me the most important one is communication and the only way to improve it is by speaking
well it depends on the kind of person you are if you have the ability to concentrate in classes it would be for sure a better option than studying on your own however there are people that feel that they progress more at home
university facilities are the place where you are going to spend most of your time during your university studies
i really hate my town because it has no shops no cinemas hardly anything
well as i usually fail my final exams my summer holidays tend to start very late so when it comes to mid july i really like to do nothing like stay in bed all day
well although it can sound a little bit evil i really do n't like to spend so much time with any of my family because they can be so annoying sometimes so i prefer to be alone or with my friend
so as a physics student i 'd really like to work in the future probably in nasa
well on the one hand i think that it could be a really good option for students because with that they are gon na have experience so in the future they can add it on their c vs so businesses hire them but on the other hand i think that a student if you are at university your main objective is to study and to get your degree and if you are working obviously you are n't gon na have all the time to dedicate to your degree and probably you are gon na fail some subjects or something like that
so if you 're gon na travel by airplane first of all you have to obviously go to the airport depending on the facilities of the city you could go by tram or train by bus or on your own or by taxi or your own car so once there you have to go to your company gate and check in your luggage then you have to pass the security control where a policeman checks your passport and your i d and checks your luggage when you pass the security control probably you will have to wait in a waiting area or you can go to a cafe
for example i have an ipad so when i am not in the mood for studying i would prefer to stay in bed but as i say i have to study i could bring my ipad to the bed and study my notes keeping warm in my bed
well obviously it depends on the teacher and the subject that you are studying but in my own experience i will say that i prefer a book rather than a teacher
so first of all if you work in groups you 'll have to deal with people so you could develop your empathy or sympathy skills being nice to other people
as i said earlier it would depend on the subject in my own experience it 's preferable to read a book alone because most of my teachers lack experience teaching students
well in my opinion it is a very important matter
it 's so beautiful in my opinion we have a castle a big castle we have great food and drink
i really like travelling it 's my main hobby i think i try to find the best prices the best offers to travel and i always travel once in my holiday
i prefer to be with my brother because we have a lot of things in common and he 's very funny in my opinion like me and yeah i love this boy
yeah i studied chemistry i 'm a chemist and i would like something to do with chemistry but trying to research something important and something about the environment
in my opinion the main advantage of getting jobs to pay for your university studies is you can help your family to pay for these studies your parents ca n't bear all the cost of your studies usually at least in spain the main disadvantage is the time it 's difficult to have the same qualification the same marks with a job
okay first you have to travel to the airport then in the airport you should look for staff to do the check in then when you do the check in and you pass the document control and the security you are ok to board the aeroplane so if you have time you could wait and have a coffee or buy a gift then you board and start your journey enjoy
in my opinion technology could be very useful for students because they want to use applications on mobile phones or laptops to improve their ways to study
but nowadays maybe technology is enough in a lot of ways to learn
students could acquire a lot of skills because you need work in a group in your daily life
i prefer to read all alone because it 's better for concentrating i think in my opinion attending lectures could be a big distraction for the students
i think it 's very important to have learning facilities for students because the university is like a door to the real world and they need a lot of facilities to work and to live
i love the traditions and different cultures and i 'm so interested in that and i think it 's so very clever to know about other countries i want to do that
i love watching series on netflix or prime video and also i love playing or hanging out with my family too i play with my dog and go out with my friends i love to have a good time
i think listening listening to music in english listening to series i love to watch series in english because it 's the original language and reading a lot of english books or something like that
and i would like to have a friendship with all the people in this world
so we know that the pollution the air pollution comes from factories and vehicles so this pollution goes up and makes acid particles that are in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wind and that means that they could mix with other particles and some acid particles fall as dust in the world and acid particles are in rain and snow normally and that causes damage to the environment
first of all they should drink a lot of water it 's very important and eat a lot of fruits it 's so important because these fruits have the proteins and vitamins that our body needs
it 's very good to do a little bit of exercise every day but you have to have a routine and do a little bit for example fifteen minutes per day it 's good
well i think so i think that it is very important to sleep because sleeping makes you feel better makes you feel your body has more energy and that 's so important
obviously negative because maybe for some people it 's so bad for their eyes
it 's a town located near the city of huelva you can find this town in the south of spain midway between seville and huelva
so honestly i really enjoy having enough time to do as many things as i want to do and try to do things which i have never done before
i ca n't choose one person from my whole family however if i have to say just one i could say my cousin because we are the same age and we have been together our whole lives
i would like to be an international lawyer because i am deciding which field of law is more suitable for me and i think i would like to solve international problems or international issues
so on the one hand working to pay for the university studies allows you to be finally independent and you can manage your own money you can decide what you are going to spend and you are going to manage your own money on the other hand as a disadvantage you have to work at the same time as you are studying and maybe you are not going to have free time or enough time for you but in my own opinion it 's really important to work while you are studying because you can appreciate the free time and the effort
i 'm going to talk about travelling by airplane so when you have a flight you have to go to the airport and you have many different ways to go there which are car bus or train and then you have to pass the security control to ensure you have no prohibited things with you and maybe you have to wait just five or ten minutes and you can stay in a restaurant and then you have to board the airplane
so technology is an important tool to learn a lot of things
in my opinion the teacher has to teach face to face because the teacher can provide more information more knowledge
i think the most important skill students have to have is to communicate and organize organisation is really important to create an amazing project
in my opinion attending lectures can be prejudicial for the students
i think it 's really important to provide learning facilities because the student can concentrate better on the subject because he has the facilities
i really appreciate the environment where we live so i personally feel that all of us should look after our land and i firmly believe that if each one does their part we will get better
we have a soft spot for watching series together however i prefer watching films on netflix to watching series together because i really really appreciate my time
i have to admit that by far the person who i am really similar to is my mother because our faces are quite similar and also when we are speaking sometimes people confuse our voices because they are so similar
when i was a child i used to think that i would like to live in london however actually i am used to living in a little town like for example now in brazil or before in poland i really like small towns
so let 's begin by speaking about the advantages of this idea i firmly believe that taking a short time per day to do some exercise would be really beneficial for students to help them be active and as well there are also some disadvantages like for example schools will have less time for doing their lessons like for example science and another part would be that maybe some students wo n't want to do any exercise so they will lose time at school but despite all these advantages and disadvantages i firmly believe that this idea is really good and it should be recognized by schools and schools should take part and go ahead
so well today i will talk about how bees produce honey so let 's begin by saying that bees collect nectar from flowers outside so they collect the nectar and they bring the nectar to their home where they make honey from nectar in beehives after all of that there is a human part where beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives and the same person puts the honey in different bottles and that 's all i have to say in this production part
how much is the rent how much would the food there cost and all this stuff
studying in a second language could help you to improve your abilities to speak another language and this will also be very useful when you want to get a new job for example because the more you know the more you understand the world
this is a very difficult question because it depends on the students
firstly if the students want to know something about local culture they should go to traditional parties for example or ask local people there
i have to confess that i totally agree with that statement because i believe that everyone needs one moment in their life to feel comfortable with themselves and to develop their independence
i live in a three bedroom house it is located slap bang in the city centre and it is a very nice and cosy house and i love to stay at home rather than going out in the current scenario with the virus
so holiday is a part of life which i never want to miss and when i am on holiday i love to go trekking and capture scenic views of landscapes which is one of my favourite hobbies as well
okay so this is a tricky question he is just one year old and all day i love to enjoy his naughtiness and play different kinds of games with him
talking about jobs i would love to do a teaching job
in my opinion nowadays students should do a part time job in order to pay for their university studies which may help to broaden their horizons in terms of new skills which helps them develop their personality besides this they can learn tremendous skills in terms of teamwork which is helpful to develop their personality and that might be helpful in studies as well talking about the cons of this to my knowledge there is just one disadvantage of the job which is devoting less time to study so i agree that doing part time jobs is much better than doing only studies
in this day and age we have lots of resources to use like internet technology which can be used to study and learn for i think one can learn from the internet because there are plenty of things on the internet to learn and study
i fully agree with this statement that face to face learning is the best option because we can get feedback straight away and also by learning face to face we can get all the answers to our queries or questions from the tutor
it helps to build a lot of skills including team skills and communication skills
in my opinion attending lectures is more effective than reading alone one may get bored by reading alone and may fall asleep but attending lectures make you more and more curious to learn more
it is extremely important for the university to get updated with learning facilities like superfast internet and p cs laptops and all these technological devices which are needed by students to help them learn and study more
i like to do sports or exercise ride a bicycle and read books or comics
i can speak english with my boyfriend or with friends
i 'd like to be invisible
if all university students do a part time job is the advantage is they earn a lot of money
the acid is carried by pollution up in the air the acid particles are in smoke and the acid particles are carried by wind and the acid particles are in rain and snow and damage the environment because they are very dangerous
drinking water is very important because my body needs water i could not live without water
in my opinion it is necessary to do sport every day so the body is healthy
i think that you have to sleep seven or eight hours in order to have a well rested body and a fully charged battery
the technology is very good because it helps with running
i live in a big flat which is near to the centre of the town it has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and the dining room is very big
i really like spending time with my friends going for a walk or listening to music sometimes watching a film or reading an interesting book you know
my only brother he 's very special and we really like going for a walk you know around the forest or talking about any kind of issue or topic
i would love to be a teacher because i really like teaching kids and i 'd also like to have you know really long holidays in summer
so i think that one of the advantages is that if you do n't have a lot of time to study you concentrate better and your time is used more effectively you know and on the other hand you will be exhausted with no time for your friends so i think you have to be very careful if you get a job while you 're studying so in my opinion if you can do n't work at the same time but sometimes life challenges us so then i can tell you go for it and study and work like it 's the best thing you can do
if you want to travel by plane there are a few steps that you need to know first of all you have to go to the airport in some form of transport like by car or by bus or train then you arrive at the airport and it 's time to do the check in pass through document control and then the security guards will see if everything is okay then you have to wait in the waiting area you can have something to eat or go to the bathroom or restroom or have a coffee and finally they will call you to board and it 's time for the plane to take off
so they can search for information on the internet to improve their knowledge
yes i think it 's more special you know because the teacher can answer your question right away
they will learn how to work together and to not always see their opinion as the right opinion and share responsibilities also i think it 's very good
yes i think when someone lectures you you will take in more information than by yourself and then later you can read everything alone to understand it
i think it 's more important now than anything else
very interested unfortunately i do n't have money to travel but i am very interested in learning about other countries cultures and languages
i like reading i like listening to music i like watching t v and netflix i like cooking too i like making desserts for my family
for me it 's listening to music and watching cartoons i watch a lot of cartoons and i listen to lots of music in english and for me that 's the best way for me obviously for other people there 's a different way to that
i think i would like to learn other languages like really just other languages i am fascinated by that
talking about university students and part time jobs they should be doing that i mean one of the advantages is they would know the outside world as it is a disadvantage would be that they would n't have time to focus on their studies that 's what they should be doing but in my own opinion most of the students there are not able to pay for their college they are already doing part time jobs so if everyone did it would be just you know fair to everyone everyone would know the world as it is and everyone would have the disadvantage of not having a hundred percent of their time to focus on studying
acid rain is really easy to understand hear me out factories and vehicles they produce smoke some of these acid particles can fall as dust and they cause damage to the environment other acid particles the lighter ones they are mixed with cloud water so when this water in the clouds falls as rain or snow it is not just water or snow that is falling it 's water or snow plus acid so it causes lots of damage to the environment it 's really easy
first of all look for a nutritionist if they are good they are going to give you a really good plan that you can work with and it will be close to what you 're used to and you will create the habit of eating good things
not every day but at least two to three times a week exercise is good for your health is good for your body and you have to keep your body functioning well and exercise is going to help with that so do it at least two to three times a week
i totally agree it is in our sleep that our body recovers our energy that our metabolism works better so it 's in our sleep that our body functions you know recharges itself so sleep eight hours people
i think technology is a tool and as a tool can be used with a positive and a negative effect so in this case it might have a negative effect but it 's not technology 's fault it 's people 's
i am really interested in the environment because we have a responsibility for the world
i really like going to the cinema with them because we laugh very much and then we can speak about the film we have just seen i like it so much
well i think my husband is similar to me because we understand each other and we laugh very much together and we think the same about many things
i would like to live in london for example because i would like to learn english the english language i think in spain it 's so difficult to speak it
i think the advantages are for example that it is necessary for health for our health but the disadvantages are for example that we can do fitness out of classes in schools and colleges i think the students can do fitness classes in the gym out of school in my opinion i think it is so important fitness exercise sports and it is possible that you 'll try fitness classes
well i will explain how honey is produced first bees collect nectar from flowers and go to their beehives and the bees make honey from the nectar and then beekeepers collect the honey from these beehives and then they go directly to the shop and in the shop the customers buy them
well i think students choosing a country would like london because if they look at the parties and the university it is ok
they find difficulties with the language and the culture
they can learn about the children
i think it 's absolutely true because they need to have lunch alone to cook to make payments and
the place where i live is very beautiful and it 's very very tranquil
when i have a holiday i enjoy listening to music spending time with my family and doing exercise with my friends and reading books
my family and i like to eat in our favourite restaurant because we enjoy eating a lot of food
i would like to have my own company in the future and help my family economically because it is very important to me to do this
to get jobs to pay for your university studies has some advantages like you can be independent financially and you can have more work experience
as you can see in the diagram if you travel to another country first of all you have to travel to the airport finally you must wait for the airplane and finally you can board the airplane
students should use technology to practice their activities at university to understand in a better way the concepts and information that their professors give them
face to face learning is important because you can ask the professor some questions if you have doubts
group projects are an interesting thing in which you can learn more about your topics because you experiment with the activities
attending lectures is important because you can hear specialised professors so you can learn more about the topics
i 'm from yokohama so i 'll tell you about yokohama yokohama has many sightseeing places for example chinatown and museums chinatown is a good place
i always enjoy playing american football and talking with my friends so i belong to an american football club so i like american football and playing american football
i spend free time with my little brother he is ten years old i like him and i read books to my brother
i want to be a pilot so i want to work in an aviation company i like airplanes and commercial planes so i want to work there
i think all students should not get jobs to pay for all their university studies i have two reasons first we should focus on study in universities that is why i think all students should not get jobs to pay for all their university studies
okay i will tell you about travelling by airplane first you arrive at the airport with transportation like a car or a bus or train and then you have to check in and you go to document control to check your bags and luggage third step you should wait in the hall and you can go to the bathroom and eat lunch finally you can board the airplane
we can use technology instead of our brain because i think we use the brain only to consider
i think face to face is important because we can communicate with people face to face we express our feelings
i think attending a lecture is better than studying alone
i think it is necessary to provide modern learning facilities because we must keep up with the times so we can get knowledge
well i am really interested in learning about other countries because for my career i need to learn about other cultures how they deal with bargains and all these things so i prefer to take advantage of knowing about these cultures when making my deals
i 'm keen on doing exercise it 's really important for me for example i go to the gym and do some exercise with the dumbbells and well i feel stronger and feel good about myself so for me it 's incredible
i get a buzz from listening to music it 's incredible because you can put your headphones on and improve your skills in english because you can listen to some words that you never heard before in your life so that is the best way to learn and maybe reading
well i would prefer to learn gymnastics rather than learn about i do n't know other topics because it 's very important for me that with these movements i feel great about myself and about my body i want to reach my limits
many students at the moment do part time jobs this has many advantages you can develop new skills and the things that professional environment wants from other people and improve your knowledge about the things that you learn in the school on the other hand the disadvantages of this are that there are many students who do n't have time or maybe are not sufficiently organised to do these things and it 's difficult for many people yes however in my opinion you need to do this and take the risk to do both things because in the future many companies will be impressed by your story about how you know all these things and well you can say ah well i was a student and an employee so i can do both
so in this presentation i am going to show how acid rain is formed from pollution and the particles mix with the cloud water and maybe in the future this could be very very hard for many people for their skin and they could suffer some dramatic situations because the environment is not the best for us at the moment so we need to save the environment and clean things
well i recommend people drink one point five liters of water every single day to be hydrated and feel comfortable in themselves that is important because water is life and life is very important for everyone you know
yeah for me it 's really essential
well as we said technology is very important right now people need these new devices to improve their health and i think it 's the best way to improve the lives of people with technology you know
i think it 's interesting because you know about different things also you know about how people think or how people do things so i think it is very important and also it is very interesting
i like to do different activities in my free time
i like to do different things to improve my english i like to watch movies a lot because it helps me to improve my speaking and my listening also i like to read my favourite books
i want to learn swimming because i think it 's very important also it is very good for our health for our body to keep fit also it is important i think
first of all i think the advantage of a part time job for a student while studying is it will help them to focus on another thing not just studying and it will help them to reduce their stresses and also get a little money that will help them with their studies but i think that the disadvantage is they maybe focus on their work and forget about their studying in my opinion it is a very good idea to work part time because it helps them to be more relaxed calm and happy
the acid rain started from factories and vehicles they make pollution and they go out and then when they get to the wind and mix with the clouds some of it falls as dust and the other acid particles mix with cloud water acid particles are in rain or snow so they come to earth in rain or snow and acid rain is very damaging to our environment
first i want to avoid eating fast food and want to drink a lot of water also eat a lot of vegetables and fruit because it is very important for health
drinking lots of water is very important because it cleans dirt from our body also it is very important for our brain because it makes it work well
i think it is very important to do exercise every day because it is very important for our body and for our brain and it reduces stress also it helps us to be more relaxed and happy and also keeps our body fit
i think it is right
i think it has negative effects on people because nowadays we just stay at the computer or any piece of technology and eat and everything comes to us so i think we should look at our life and try to change it
i am very interested as we all live on the planet
we like both playing sports and having some drinks we usually play some football matches on weekends and then we usually go to bars and have some beers and talk about life
almost everybody says i take after my mother they say we are both really alike and i think that 's the answer my mother i 've looked at photos of her as a child
i do n't really know yet but maybe another country just to explore new places new cultures new languages and new food and new people of course
i think that 's a good idea but more for schools than colleges disadvantages i do n't really see any disadvantages maybe in college people are avoiding studying more important things in my opinion this is necessary in schools to get p e classes
so this diagram shows how honey is produced at first there are animals that are called bees that collect nectar from flowers many flowers they travel to their beehives where all the bees make honey but not in a way we can consume so that 's the beekeepers ' aim they bottle it and put it in the transport usually a van or in other types of transport and just get it in shops to be bought
they should consider things like the culture they have the language they speak
studying in a second language it 's difficult but your second language will improve a lot if you study and talk every day in the second language
maybe being by themselves and not living with their families
they will learn about the local culture every day when they communicate they talk with native speakers and they are living in the streets every day visiting monuments and eating their food
that 's evident when you are not still living with your family you are living by yourself with maybe some roommates it will help you to cook by yourself clean everything in the house be more independent
the place where i live is very nice i like it a lot it has very good weather we have a beach so at the weekends we can go out to the beach and have a good time with our friends and also i like that it 's not that big so we do n't have a lot of traffic
it depends where i go for the holiday but if it 's a beach i prefer sometimes to stay in the hotel and enjoy all the experiences the hotel gives us but when it 's to a city i prefer getting to know the city more
a person in my family that i enjoy spending time with is my little brother because i can play a lot with him and he 's very funny and i never get bored and also we have like very different characters so we get along well
my dream job is to be a professional dancer but i am not studying for that so i think that in the future i will be working as an industrial engineer and i hope to be working in a very sophisticated business
i am going to be talking about whether students should get jobs to pay for their university studies and i think that it 's not a must but if we can do it it 's ok like it 's great if we can help out our parents with some money because i know that sometimes it can get really stressful for our parents to pay for our studies coz university it 's very expensive everywhere and i also think that we have to just help them out but some of the disadvantages are that sometimes we can get really stressed with that and we can end up with lower grades in my opinion it 's better if you do n't do it
i am going to be talking about what you need to do to travel by airplane and first you have to get to the airport you have to go by bus by car by whatever you want then you have to do a check in because that 's the way that you say that you are there on time and they register all your suitcases then you have to go to a document control then pass the security because they do n't allow a lot of items like weapons and knives then you have to go to an area where you have to wait till you can board the airplane and finally you board the airplane and then you are ready to go to your destination and that 's all
i think that technology has given us a lot of good ways to study and one way we can use technology is we can record ourselves and then listen again to the recording to memorise everything more easily and quickly
i agree with them because when we have virtual classes we do n't pay as much attention as when we have a face to face class with a professor coz we do n't feel the pressure of having to give a hundred percent in the class
i think that the most important skill that we develop is that we get to improve our communication and also to be very patient with our friends because sometimes we get very stressed when they do n't do anything and yeah
i think reading alone is better because we are focused on what we are reading and when we attend lectures i think that we lose a little bit of the focus on what we are studying
a lot because nowadays we have like a lot of technology and a lot of different new things that we can use for us to learn more like for example there are a lot of pages online that have games for us to have a more entertaining way to learn
i separate the trash and use products that can be reused and when i 'm not at home i turn off the lights and use some ecological products
my mum is most similar to me we enjoy the same things do the same things and we have the same likes
i would be delighted if i could live at the beach i would enjoy it a lot listening to the sound of the sea
nowadays mexico is at number one for obesity it 's very very bad for youth so the schools and the universities need to include sports classes to help the population to have a healthier lifestyle and do campaigns to decrease the rate of obesity
good morning and thanks for coming today i will talk about how honey is produced first you know that the bees collect the nectar from flowers next the bees make honey from nectar in beehives the beekeepers collect the honey from beehives
the most important aspect to consider when you want to choose the city or the country where you are going to study is whether this country is very safe for you
actually all the bosses need to have more qualified employees
i think that the most difficult situation is that you are far from home you do n't know a lot of people in the new country but you need to makr a lot of new friends to not be alone
the easiest way to know about the other culture in your new country is to talk with people talk with people and make new friends that teach you about the culture of the country
what we enjoy doing together is for example watching a t v program playing football or cooking in my kitchen even if we are preparing different subjects for the exams
the most similar member of my family is my father because physically we are really the same the same weight the same appearance
in the future i would like to be in singapore because i love their technological advances and their politicians
as far as i 'm concerned the crux of the matter is that one of advantages is for example that with your class you will keep fit and you will have a healthy body one of the disadvantages i think is that if you go to school to study and in the school you do fitness classes you need to spend more time in your house preparing for your lessons and your exams
first bees take the nectar from flowers next bees with this nectar make honey in beehives when the bees make honey beekeepers take the bees ' honey from beehives to fill jars and with these jars inside a car or a truck the jars are transported to different and diverse places supermarkets for example or local shops big commercial centres or even your house and when they have the jars in your supermarket for one or two pounds you can buy one
i guess that the advantage is that when you are studying a subject and you learn about it you only learn one thing but if you study in a second language you can learn both things at the same time really
it 's difficult because you need to get on with other people you need to be more independent and do things such as clean your kitchen or sweep the floor and it 's very hard when you live alone
i believe that you do n't really know the local culture when you go abroad during the months during the weeks you can see other people you can hear different things and then you learn about this local culture
obviously when you live alone or you live with your classmates or colleagues you will have more responsibilities because when you live in your country and you are a student normally you live with your parents
cadiz is a very sunny city it has two main beaches and the weather is really comfortable it 's always sunny and a little bit windy
when i 'm on holiday i mostly travel to different countries i 'm very interested in the culture of central and northern europe so whenever i have the opportunity i travel there so i can see the cities their aesthetic their architecture i visit museums and so on
and even our characters are very much alike we do n't resemble each other
you can grow as a person you can learn how to manage your time and then you are able to enter adult life the main disadvantages i see are that although it has many benefits you also will have less time to study less time to spend with your friends less time for yourself ultimately so that 's my thinking
well travelling by airplane is one of the most common ways to travel nowadays and the stages you need to follow to travel by plane are as follows first you have to travel to the airport by car by bus by train and then you have to check in with your company then pass document control with the police and a security control they check your bags after that you have to wait for the boarding time for your plane then board and then the plane flies to your destination
i really agree with that statement because teachers have the knowledge and have the skill to pass on their own knowledge so that 's a very important skill
i think group projects are great to learn the basic skill of teamwork which you will need in your professional life most definitely although it can also lead to distractions and to confrontation i think that 's a very positive skill to learn
yes definitely i think that attending lectures is one of the best ways to grasp a concept that you can potentially not understand when studying on your own so yes i agree
learning facilities are the foundation stone of learning
i 'm so interested and i try to help it because it is our home
we really enjoy going to parties together getting out to go and how can i say that eat or go dancing or singing i love to go to the pool
the most similar to me is my brother i have a twin he is younger than me but only by three minutes
so you need to be prepared for these fitness classes
next bees make honey from nectar in beehives the next step is beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives they need to be protected
studying in a second language is hard at the beginning but as time passes you are going to improve your language and you are going to speak normally
local culture is very important because when you go to another country you need to get into this type of culture
i 'm interested in learning about other countries and i want to learn computer science in the united states
my free time is spent reading books and watching movies and talking to friends and going to restaurants
i do n't have an idea of which one is the best one because i 'm just finding out now but so far online learning is best i think
i want more communication skills and i want to talk with more people
the advantages are a good salary and yeah the students understand what 's going on when they work in the future but the disadvantage is they do n't have the time to study so in my opinion they should n't do part time jobs all students should n't do part time jobs while they are studying because yeah some students want to study more so yeah
and secondly acid particles are carried by wind into other areas and next some acid particles fall as dust to the land and the other acid particles mix with cloud water and finally rain falls and acid particles are in rain and acid rain damages the environment
please eat more vegetables and fruits and do n't eat much meat or some other kinds of ingredients
drinking water is important because eighty percent of the human body is water so please drink water
doing exercise every day is not essential but yeah if you can you should do it i think and yeah exercising once a week is very important
depends on the person i think there 's people who need seven hours or eight hours but i think people should know how long they need
well i enjoy spending my free time mostly in two ways one is listening to music and the other is reading books his books are really awesome
well in my opinion the best way for me to improve my english is to form a habit of getting exposed to an english environment so when i am in a class i will always get involved in the class and in the teaching
well i want to learn how to play the piano because i love the delicate yet powerful sound it makes and i want to play sweet songs for those who need music bringing happiness and enthusiasm to those who need it that 's all
well as the old saying goes there are two sides to every coin doing a part time job has both advantages and disadvantages on the one hand doing a part time job can build our confidence and provide us with a chance to improve our skills and prepare for future jobs but on the other hand if one spends most of the time doing part time jobs that could reduce the time spent studying so my opinion is that everyone who wants to do a part time job should think carefully before taking that decision that 's all
ladies and gentlemen it 's my honour to be here to give a presentation about acid rain it starts from factories and vehicles they give off pollution into the air and acid particles are in the smoke so this is how it damages our environment ladies and gentlemen we only have one earth and that 's the reason why we should take care of it thank you for listening
it 's of great importance and then prepare lunch and dinner well because they 'll give you energy
well i think drinking a lot of water is of great importance and only water can protect us from being thirsty
so this is the foundation of the happy life we have
well i think this question depends on the individual because some people need to sleep eight hours or more
i like travel so much
i usually watch t v once a day i run round my village
the best way to improve my english is talking with english people because they could help me with my english
the advantage of students doing part time jobs while they are studying is they could earn money so they could buy anything with their money and the disadvantage is they would have less time to study to prepare their assignments
the centre of the city produces pollution and the factory produces pollution this pollution is converted into acid particles they are in smoke these acid particles fly on the wind and other particles acid particles are in rain or snow
in my opinion people should n't eat junk food because that food is bad for your health
drinking water is really important you have to drink water five times a day it is really important for your body
yes do exercise at least once a day you only need thirty minutes it 's enough
i think that it 's ok because you should n't sleep more than eight hours or less than six hours
i think that it 's positive because you can talk with another person at any time you can use whatsapp
i live in a small flat with my boyfriend and my two cats my flat is very small but it is very cute and i have a big balcony and the windows are very big too
with my family i enjoy spending time going for a walk in a forest or going to a camping site sleeping in a tent and lighting a fire
well in the future i will want a job in a human resources department in a factory for example and i will do the payrolls and the
well i think that if you pay for your university studies it 's because you will try to find a job a good job but no this is not true some people study in the university and do n't find a job related to their studies in my opinion a lot of people study for example human resources my degree but no one is in a job connected with employment law or in a human resources department
to travel by plane in the first instance you need to travel to the airport by car by bus or by train it 's not important in the airport the first thing is the check in and you check in your suitcase for example and the police check your documents and your suitcase if you want you can have a coffee or go to the bathroom and then you board the plane and finally the plane takes off
i think that the students can use technology it 's very important because in the classroom they can do an exercise on a laptop for example
well i think that it 's better that people learn face to face with the teacher but now with the coronavirus and the quarantine skype or zoom are necessary for people to learn
well i think it 's very important to do a project in a group because people learn to listen and communicate
no i think that people learn much better alone reading alone because you 're in your room at your desk it 's the best way to learn
i think that it is necessary that universities try to provide as many learning facilities as it 's possible because it 's very important to the learning of the students
i enjoy meeting friends meeting my family i enjoy studying english searching on the internet or just walking in the park
i most enjoy spending time with my daughter she is a beautiful young woman with creative thinking and she can give me a lot of good advice
i want to get a job in the near future in a non government organisation
the advantages for a student who has a job while he 's studying at university is having experience and skills for his future speciality the disadvantage is a lack of time for studying and preparing for tomorrow 's classes
first you should travel to the airport to arrive there on time then you need to go to check in your luggage after the police check your documents and security check your luggage all your suitcases you should wait until this process is finished after that you will be invited to the gate and finally you will board the plane
technology makes the studies of students easier internet search engines and e books are partially replacing traditional books
i think this studying face to face with your teacher is the best way to study well because the teacher during the process of studying can correct your mistakes
first is the skill of getting along with team members and having good communication this means students must have good communication skills
attending lectures involves communication between teacher and students
providing modern learning facilities is very important because it makes the process of studying easier for students
do you know practice makes perfect everyone says that and it really works and that is a fact and if you really really want to improve your english practice every day
i would be trying anything to do with creativity and the arts because there is something interesting about that
i think the question is about whether students should do part time jobs while they are studying and the disadvantage for me is maybe your focus will be divided coz you will be doing the part time job at the same time as you are studying at university and my opinion about that is it 's about your preference if you can maintain your time management very well i think doing a part time job is a good thing for you
so some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water
i do n't think i have any good advice for this question but my simple advice is reflection why are you eating good food what 's your motive to do this it 's for yourself
yeah i think so doing exercise is essential because it makes your body stretch and makes your body healthy for the future so you must do exercise as much as you can even if you 're busy doing your work so do it ten minutes a day
i think it depends on their age or their activity levels coz a human is a complicated system so each one is different so the important thing that you have to remember is sleep enough so yeah
of course in my opinion technology makes everything so instantly effective and efficient it 's positive but part of you must remember to balance it coz too much of anything it 's not good for you
i got interested when i was a child i always like to learn about other countries and other languages
i spend my free time reading books watching series watching movies and dancing
the best way to improve my english is reading watching videos listening to podcasts and music and speaking in front of the mirror
the disadvantage is they have less time to study and my opinion is it is important that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because it 's important the students work and study at the same time
well acid rain happens because of pollution as you can see factories and cars end up polluting the air with carbon dioxide these particles in the smoke are blown away by the wind and some acid particles fall like a dust those blown away by the wind mix with clouds of water then cause acid rain or fall with snow
drinking water is important because our body needs hydrating and our kidneys need it to keep working
yes doing exercise every day is very important for our body and our health
a good night 's sleep means a good day of work
lately technology has become a great enemy of health because it has made people sedentary
i love their history
i love to play football i like to play video games and i go to the gym every day
the advantage i think for the people that work and study is they have money and opportunities to become experienced
the pollution begins when the factories work and smoke comes out the engines then the pollution goes up to the sky and the wind mixes this smoke in the sky with the clouds acid particles mix with cloud water and finally the acid particles are in rain and snow doing damage to the environment
ok if youwant to have good eating habits you must eat fruits and vegetables and do n't eat hamburgers
it 's very important because humans really need to drink water every day if you do n't drink water you can be sick
i think eight hours or seven hours that 's a good time to sleep
i think it 's very positive because you can find new jobs using technology and you can create applications or different things to contribute to humanity with technology
i am interested because i need to improve my english
i spend my time studying english and watching t v series without subtitles
at this moment it is speaking with you
the disadvantages are that students will divide their time between work and study if they do not have discipline it 's a problem it is essential for their future career
and these acid particles are carried by wind some acid particles fall as dust to rivers for example and the other acid particles mix with cloud water and transform into your rain and snow in synthesis pollution is very bad it damages the environment
i think technology is for different activities in your day and i think it 's very good if you use it with discipline and good sense
it 's a really really beautiful city in spain it feels like home i find a lot of people who are very very kind so this is a wonderful wonderful city in this country
during my holidays usually i like to watch a lot of movies for example in the christmas holidays i really like to watch christmas films classics and new ones so it 's like a hobby during the holidays for me
oh that is an interesting question because i have two members in my family that i really like to spend my time with but my sister my answer is my sister who is like a second mother to me so i really love her and she is very kind to me i like her
oh but that 's so so interesting because right now i am studying business administration it 's my dream
well it is a little bit complicated to give an opinion on this subject but first if the students work to pay for their university studies that is interesting it 's very very interesting because they can say i can work in whatever i want and they can buy what they really want they can do it for their future the disadvantage is maybe the job can be a source of stress for the students and if they ca n't work one month or one week at the university they wo n't have the income that they need to pay their university fees from my point of view yeah it 's good but it depends on the degree and the economic situation of each student i do n't know
well travelling by airplane is nice but we must follow a lot of steps at first we must go to the airport by car train or bus in the vehicle that we want when we are in the airport we must go to the desk and do our check in or we can do it online then we must pass through document control maybe we need a visa or not it 's not always like that then we pass the security controls with our carry on bags then we have the wait it 's a little bit tiring but we must do it then we have to board the airplane and in the end we have the departure of our flight it 's wonderful
well nowadays we use a lot of technology to study for example now we have the opportunity to use different kinds of technology like ipads or tablets and also our laptops help us to study better and easier and faster
well in my view and in my own experience it 's better it 's better for me because i have a good memory when others talk to me and explain to me face to face but others say it is not always like that it depends
oh in group projects it 's really complicated sometimes and we develop our patience maybe patience and empathy are the most important abilities that we develop with these kinds of projects
to be honest for me it 's useful attending lectures is better for me but i know that a lot of people think that it is n't useful it is awful for them but i think it helps us maybe you can remember something with this kind of activity
i think it 's very very important that universities or schools or any kind of place gives us more facilities for learning because we are in a new era and we must have more modern access to information
i live in a wonderful place we 're near a swimming pool and a basketball ground i can play basketball with my friends on the weekend or after school and i can also swim with my friends
i enjoy playing basketball with my friends we play basketball with around six people and we divide into two teams we often win this game and that 's a good experience for me and good relaxation for weekends
first it can give them money to support them to pay for their college fees and it can give them an experience that can have a lot of benefits when they come into real work but if they can not manage their work life balance it will have a lot of disadvantages maybe their grades will be affected
if you want to travel by plane first you should travel to the airport you can travel by car bus or train when you come to the airport you need to check in first and document control will check your documents and you will go to the security make sure you do n't bring knives and other things that can harm people and after a long time waiting you can have some coffee buy some gifts and go to the toilet or eat something then you can go aboard that 's all
i think we can use technology to search for the answer to some difficult questions that teachers may not answer and we can also use technology to watch some videos about some important question
yes i think learning from a teacher face to face is the best way because students can learn from teachers ' movements and get a better understanding and the teacher can get students ' feedback very quickly and give them answers
i think there are many skills such as leadership skills they can lead a team and make everybody do things they want to do and they can also have the skill of cooperating with friends
i think attending a lecture is very important because the lecturer the speaker of the lecture is also a specialist in the field and they can give you a clear understanding of this field but with books you read you ca n't always get the writer 's point
i think that 's very important because students can find out how to learn from these learning facilities and teachers can get very clear feedback from students from these learning facilities
normally i go to the gym or church as well and spend some time with my family watching some movies walking on the beach for instance yeah
practicing
maybe playing piano
well it depends so it 's an advantage if you consider that they will be more responsible with their own things obviously they have some disadvantages because they will have not so much time maybe to have fun maybe sometimes to evaluate the right situations in school or maybe at work because sometimes it 's not possible to deliver in the best way in both things
so from my understanding this image is dealing with acid rain because it has a lot of consequences in our environment because it can damage the environment a lot so we have some particles that fall as dust and can fall as well as rain or snow and damage the environment so this is pollution so this is my understanding about this image
it 's very important because water is the best drink that you can have on a daily basis so it 's very important always drink water in the morning afternoon evening because it will clean your body
yes personally normally i go to the gym four times in a week and it 's very important because it 's part of healthy living
yes i totally agree because sleeping will have some consequences for our daily lives
now i am living in an apartment in the south of bogota with my wife and sometimes other persons or people from my family come to visit me
i really enjoy watching movies and eating popcorn and doing exercise and visiting my family that is all
i really enjoy spending time with my wife she is a very very very very important person in my life the most important person in my life because we spend all our time together
i think that in the future i want two different kinds of things i want to travel
but the disadvantage is that the time is very very very short that is all
ok there are six steps to travel by airplane it 's very easy the first is travel to the airport the second step is to do the check in pass through document control and security after that people need to wait to board then they need to board it is very important when people travel by airplane it 's better not to take their own car maybe travel to the airport by bus
i agree that technology is a great tool and studying is easier
that depends for some people it 's easier to learn when the teacher is near
i am very interested in learning about other countries especially cultural things
i would like to watch some videos movies t v series things like that
i would like to have some conversations with artificial intelligence to practise my english speaking and listening skills
i really want to learn coding skills especially with artificial intelligence i want to build applications with this technology
well i think one of the advantages must be that they can earn money through those part time jobs but at the same time those jobs may distract them from their studies so they may have a poor academic performance my opinion is i think those students who have good self control can try part time jobs because for them they can manage their own time there 're more advantages than disadvantages for those students yeah
and then the acid particles are carried by wind some of them may fall as dust which can damage the environment and other acid particles can mix with cloud water which can you know become rain and snow which can also become you know harmful to our environment
eat more fruits vegetables plants and beans definitely not fatty foods
water is really important to the human body and you know make sure that you drink enough water every day so that you can avoid you know illness anyway
well in my opinion it depends on the person like maybe it 's too much you know it 's not a good frequency for people to do it every day
in my opinion it depends some people may need eight hours some people may need less or some people may need more i think it just depends on different situations on different people
well i think it 's not a black and white question i think it depends on the people who use the technology like you can use it to help you find a great exercise video
i like the summer because i have hobbies like parachuting and skydiving and during the summer it 's better to practice my hobbies and it 's also good to eat and to sleep then so i prefer the summer
i was a very happy child i had time to play by myself and also with my younger sister i have a sister eight years younger than me and she was like my doll i worked a lot and played a lot with her it was a really good time for me
i hope to have a good retirement i would like to have money enough to have good healthcare and travel a lot not only inside my country but also out of the country and eat well and see a lot of different things
yes i think that university courses should include a period of back to work experience it 's important to guarantee that students will go to the work stage knowing what is waiting for them students can be prepared to be more efficient one disadvantage of this idea is that we need to have investments in laboratories and other stuff to guarantee that the work experience will be valid it will be enough to support the learning of these students in real conditions but the number of advantages of course is very great compared with the disadvantages of this kind of thing
hello i will do a presentation about people visiting three new online pop site music sites on the graph below we can see with the blue line the website music now and the orange line the site songs four you and the red line the site tunes net we can see seven days one week on the x axis and we can see a big improvement for tunes net on the last days of our survey and we can see a reduction in the other two sites music now and songs four you maybe due to the changes in the material presented on these websites
i think that disagree is a strong word i think that the team members should be encouraged to share their point of view whether it 's aligned or not aligned with that of the other members of the team
i do n't think so
i think that it 's a sensible point of view if you are looking for results in a short time maybe sometimes a guy that 's working alone will have better results
it 's very interesting to learn a new language in a country other than france and it 's a great experience for me
i enjoy my free time when i practice basketball and i play video games with my friends and my family
the best way to improve my english will be to go to an anglophone country where i can speak english all day
i want to learn english because it 's a language which offers opportunity in the world and it 's the most spoken language in the world
i think it 's a really really good thing when we are students the first problem is we have n't got experience when we start a job i do n't think it has disadvantages and this will be a great experience for all students
this image shows how pollution affects the environment some acid particles of pollution which affect all the environment like pollution can be seen in vehicles and affect all the environment
the human body is made up of sixty percent water
sleeping is important to enjoy life all day
technology can be positive and negative
i 'm really keen on new cultures i 'm from europe so i am familiar with some cultures or european cultures that 's the reason why i would love to learn about foreign cultures such as indian culture
during my free time i love visiting museums i think that learning about art and our history can explain our current situation and thanks to living in madrid i can go to several famous museums
nowadays the best way for students to improve their english will be to use artificial intelligence platforms such as this one can help students to improve the way that they speak write or their reading skills
if i had the possibility to learn a new skill definitely it would be to learn a new language maybe a language that seems difficult such as chinese or japanese this kind of language will help us in the future
university students that do part time jobs are better at organising their schedules or their studying time but on the other hand it is difficult for them to focus on their exam so it would be kind of stressful during exam periods to work and study at the same time but i will say that the optimal situation would be maybe to work in a part time job that is related to your area of studying such as for example if you are studying law it will be interesting to work with a lawyer that can help you to understand better your knowledge of law
climate change is one of the biggest challenges that human beings are facing nowadays mainly it is caused by pollution pollution that factories emit when they are functioning this pollution contains some acid particles that are both in the wind and in the clouds it is important to be aware that these kinds of acid particles get into our lakes and rivers damaging the species that live there such as octopus or maybe different kinds of fish and on the other hand the acid rain which is in the clouds can reach the forests damaging our trees
my best piece of advice in terms of eating a healthy diet will be to introduce in this diet different types of food such as vegetables cereals fresh meat
drinking water is a habit that really helps your body to maintain the energy that it needs to face your whole routine each day and it helps your organism to work better
i will say that it depends on the person and lifestyle of that person if you love doing exercise why not do it every day
the healthiest option is to sleep exactly eight hours per day but there are some studies that show that sleeping just six or seven hours per day helps as well
a positive effect of course i think that thanks to technology we can do several activities such as for example work from home or take some pictures of our daily life and also it has improved the healthcare system
i live in a city that is one of the biggest in my country
i definitely enjoy my holidays travelling to where all my family is i mean my cousins my grandfather my grandmother and having a good time with them
i would like to have a job related to engineering or related to simulation for example but i also think that i could have a job with my family for example
all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies i think the principal advantage of this is related to the students being able to get some work experience but i think that the principal disadvantage is related to time because they 'll lose time that they could use to improve in their studies my opinion is that there are more disadvantages than advantages to getting a job while being a university student
now i 'm going to tell you about travelling by airplane if you want to travel by airplane you need to travel to the airport then you need to enter the building and after this you have to check in because if you do n't you ca n't fly anywhere after that you will need to pass document control and security after waiting for some hours or maybe some minutes you will be able to board the plane this is all after all of this you can travel by airplane
the students can use the technology to search for detailed information for example topics related to university careers and this is the way that they can use it
i think if you can do classes face to face you should do that because classes online are also good but i think face to face is better
i think the principal skill that we can develop working together on group projects is effective communication because in this case we will need to solve several problems
attending lectures could be better for some people because they can get help from their classmates but in my case i prefer reading alone
i think that if we are in university we need to focus on learning facilities skills because these are the topics that will be important in the future
i am very interested in learning about new things
i like to spend my free time going to the gym
the best way to improve my english is to watch movies and series and talk when i can
all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying the advantage of that is they are gon na be responsible in their job and with money they learn about life and the disadvantage of that is they are gon na have less time to give to all the courses in the university
nowadays vehicles produce a lot of pollution and factories too so this pollution has acid particles that are in the smoke and some of these acid particles are carried by the wind and they mix with clouds and fall like water and it makes acid rain some acid particles fall as dust and pollute the rivers and the sea so the solution for that is electric vehicles so that 's it thank you all very much
drinking water is a must coz your body is composed of seventy five percent water so it is very important to drink water all day every day
doing exercise is very important for your health as you get older it 's very important for your life for everything
i think everyone should sleep at least eight hours every night so they 're gon na be prepared for the next day
i think technology has a negative effect on people 's lives coz when you spend a lot of time on your computer you do n't do exercise it 's the truth
i want to learn about cultures and languages and food that 's all
in my free time i like to study to watch movies and to cook
it is speaking about things that you like
i would like to learn other new languages
the advantage is the students we will be more prepared for the labour market they will be better professionals the disadvantage is they will have time less to study but i think it 's an important experience that all students should have
the water cycle is influenced by the pollution from factories and vehicles this is very dangerous
i eat fruit and vegetables every day usually i eat fruit and vegetables morning afternoon and evening
water is very important for health i drink water every three hours each day
like water exercise is very important for health i do exercise every day
technology is positive when it 's used in the correct way
i am very interested that 's why i chose to study environmental engineering at university and i want to be part of the transformation and make the world a better place for everyone
we like to cook especially desserts and to play board games and card games for example we like to play volleyball too or just be together talking about life and plans
definitely my twin sister we look like each other we have the same style we like to talk about the same things and we laugh about the same jokes so definitely my twin sister
i do n't know exactly but i want to have the opportunity to live by the beach for some time just have the experience of living near the ocean going there feeling the vibe and having the experience of enjoying it there
schools and colleges should make time in the school day for all students to do fitness classes as disadvantages we can talk about the weather and the need to adapt some fitness classes so all the students can take the classes and enjoy the sun and i agree it should be a priority for schools and colleges
so today i will talk about how honey is produced first of all bees collect nectar from flowers then they go to the beehives where the bees make honey from this nectar that was collected then beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put it into pots that are ready to sell then these pots go to the transportation that takes them to the supermarket where people can buy them
they should consider how safe the country is if the country gives resources to students from abroad and how immersed in their culture the student will be and how much he will learn
the advantage of studying in a second language is that you can get immersed in the culture and lifestyle you can learn new things develop new skills and be able to communicate with more people
learning the language and understanding the accents and also living far from home can be some difficulties that students can face during this time
i agree because everything depends on them what they eat how they eat when they are going to eat what they are going to do how they deal with finances
i am very much interested in learning about other countries especially about their culture and the language and everything
i like to listen to music and i enjoy playing guitar and learning other musical instruments
for me the best way to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people to travel abroad and even better to live abroad
well i would like to learn to play sitar it 's an indian instrument
all students should have part time jobs while they are studying well with it you have some advantages for example they will not worry about how they will pay for the university which is a good thing but on the other hand there are some disadvantages to it because they would not be able to concentrate on their studies they would not have enough time to learn the disciplines so in my opinion the students should n't have to work to pay for graduation from a college
well we can see in this picture how acid rain is produced on the right side of the chart you can see the sources of pollution like factories and vehicles that produce pollution these acid particles are in the smoke that goes up in the sky and these particles are carried by the wind some of the acid particles fall as dust and other particles mix with the cloud water and then finally these acid particles fall with the rain or the snow so we can see in this diagram how acid rain is produced and returned to the soil
well the best advice is to choose the right foods
drinking water is very important for our health so ideally you should drink at least two liters of water per day
yes it 's fundamental to do exercise every day especially cardio exercises also strength exercises stretching exercises so it 's very important to exercise in different ways to improve your health
well i agree that most people need about eight hours per day some people may need seven hours some people a little more but on average a lot of people need eight hours of sleep per day
i think nowadays technology has a terrible effect on people 's health especially on their spine people spend so much time on their mobile phone with their neck in a bad position so in general technology is bad for health
i am very interested in learning about other countries
in my free time i enjoy studying english trying to learn something new and trying to speak i want to improve my english
i think practising a lot is the best way for me to improve my english
if i could learn a new skill it would be speaking english better or speaking other languages like french and german
i think all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying i think there are some advantages for them to earn some money while they are at university and as for the disadvantages i can say that while working or while doing part time jobs they can not find perhaps enough time to study their own lessons so they might fail in their studies or in their exam in my opinion each student can arrange their own situation
as you know vehicles and factories produce smoke and this smoke pollutes the air in this polluted air there are acid particles and these particles are carried by wind and after some time these acid particles are in the form of rain or snow and fall down to the earth 's surface so they damage the environment
i do n't agree with that because this may be true for children because children need more than eight or ten hours but for an adult six hours sleep is enough i think
so it 's a positive effect
i think learning in a foreign country is a really interesting thing i can be exposed to foreign culture and see many sights i have never seen before
but last weekend i went to the beach to enjoy the sunshine and the sounds of the waves
i think the best way to improve my english is to practice more only by practising more can i speak fluently and write academically
but i am not talented in maths and i will try to learn it in the future
part time jobs have positive and negative effects for university students while they are studying for positive effects they have more opportunities to take responsibility for their tuition and they can make a plan for their money however the part time job may distract their attention from studying and maybe have an active impact on their marks so from my perspective i think some part time jobs may have a bad effect for students university students
how is acid rain created they pour into the air in the smoke and then they are carried by the wind some acid particles fall as dust and both forms will damage the environment like the soil trees and creatures
you need to eat both meat and vegetables maybe eggs and fruits
it is really important to drink water every day
i think that eight hours ' sleep is beneficial for almost everyone but maybe someone only needs fewer hours to refresh their mind and they do n't need eight hours
it is a fairly quiet city where you can go out to party with friends and it is a beautiful city for studies and other things than doing sports
during the holidays i really like to party go out with my friends to different places and why not different countries i also like to do sports like basketball
one person from my family who i enjoy spending time with is my sister
in the future i want to be a physiotherapist because i am studying for this profession and it 's my dream to become a physiotherapist
there are many advantages of working to pay for your studies first of all it allows us to be autonomous and not to have to always ask our parents for help it also allows us to meet new people however the fact of working takes a lot of time and we can revise much less which can be an inconvenience during our studies in my opinion it is a good thing to work during our studies because i did it last year but we also have to find time to work on our classes and find time for our family for our girlfriend and for our friends because that 's very important in university life
i 'm going to present the different stages that people need to go through to travel by airplane first of all we must travel to the airport and once we are in the airport we can check in and show our documents to pass security second we can wait in a restaurant go to the toilet and have a coffee and finally we can board the plane and go to our destination
i think of technology as a great advance for the world because it allows us to do a lot of research and makes our lives a lot easier however we have to be careful how much time we spend on technologies
studying with a teacher face to face is really enriching because he can explain to us directly if we do n't understand certain things
i think that working in a group is a good thing because it allows us to develop more skills like friendship skills and allows us to meet people and make friends
it is very important to develop learning facilities because they allow students to be more autonomous and to find working methods in order to have good results in different tests
i live in shanghai shanghai is a bustling metropolis which is famous for its futuristic skylines vibrant culture and its prosperous economy it is also a city with a long history dating back more than a thousand years
on my holidays i usually go to dance clubs dancing boosts my muscular strength and flexibility as well as improving my coordination and balance also while dancing i improve my confidence
i would like to spend most of my time with my mother because we are both avid readers and we love to share our different opinions about a book or a piece of knowledge inside it and she always encourages me to voice my opinion
well i would like to become a diplomat in the future so that i can voice opinions on different issues on behalf of my motherland i know it 's a demanding job and requires effort but i 'll seize any opportunities to improve my abilities
there 's no getting away from the fact that more and more students are willing to take a part time job while they are studying at universities and this kind of phenomenon does have some advantages students seize opportunities to earn incomes and they get a salary for their work which helps their parents save a lot of money and should be encouraged but it has some disadvantages like part time jobs may distract students from their normal study process and do some harm to their academic scores so my opinion is that they should balance their work and study in order to develop themselves while having access to the wider society
now i 'm going to introduce the steps of travelling by airplane first you should take some transportation to the airport you can take a bus or drive a car or take the underground after you arrive at the airport what you should do next is to check in that is to say to put your luggage on the plane ahead of time then you go to document control some officials will do some checks in order to ensure security finally after you have passed the checks you can enter the waiting room during the waiting time you can choose to go shopping or have a coffee or eat something if you 're feeling peckish finally you can go on board and have a good time
so first technology can offer us a lot of new information
well learning face to face sometimes boosts efficiency and makes me more focused on learning itself
there are many advantages and second students can learn the spirit of cooperation which is very important in society
i think attending lectures is sometimes more effective because when you are listening to others ' opinions you are observing subjectively and efficiently to judge whether what they said is true or false but when you are reading books you may sometimes just get distracted
my best ways to improve my skills in english are practising writing and speaking especially by reading a book and watching a movie
of course i will be happy about it because i can be more effective in communicating with other people and in my work
in my opinion doing a part time job while they are studying has some advantages and disadvantages the advantage is they can be responsible for themselves and the disadvantage is it can interfere with their time to study i think it can be tried but in a proportion that is not too much
how pollution causes acid rain first pollution from factories and vehicles is emitted and becomes acid particles in smoke and then these acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles fall as dust and some other acid particles mix with cloud water and become rain or snow now that rain or snow can cause damage to the environment because it is a bad phenomenon
do n't eat fatty foods
it does n't need to be heavy just consistent
and i agree with sleeping more than eight hours
but i think technology has more good effects on our health because it helps us more
i 'm very interested in learning about different countries when i go on vacation i always visit different places i have visited germany japan and finland
when i have free time i usually do sports i like playing badminton very much i love playing badminton especially doubles when i play with my friends we always have a lot of fun
i always try to speak with my friends in english and i also take english courses because teachers can correct my errors and i also have opportunities to speak with native speakers
i want to learn how to play the guitar i like the guitar 's sound i think it 's cool to play the guitar while you are singing and it can warm up the atmosphere too so i want to learn this new skill
there are advantages if university students do part time jobs for example students can gain skills and work experience and they can earn some pocket money if they want to buy things like a cell phone they can pay for it themselves and through the work experience they can become independent on the other hand they may have no time for their studies and their studies can take longer too because they 're doing part time jobs personally i do n't think all university students should do part time jobs
good afternoon everyone it 's my pleasure to give a presentation on acid rain please look at this diagram first we see pollution comes from factories and vehicles then acid particles are in smoke next acid particles are carried by wind there are two possibilities here first some acid particles fall as dust other acid particles mix with cloud water after that acid particles are in rain or snow that 's how acid rain is formed acid rain can damage the environment that brings me to the end of my presentation thank you for listening
i would suggest that they should have three regular meals every day and they should eat vegetables and fruit as much as possible so that they can get enough vitamins
it 's important to drink a lot of water if you do n't drink enough it 's easy to get dehydrated if the body does n't have enough water you will feel very tired and you have no energy to do anything
basically it 's essential to do exercise every day we do n't need to do very much even twenty minutes would be ok the most important thing is we keep moving and we live well
i think it depends on the person some people need eight hours some people need only five hours so the most important thing is you sleep enough if you sleep enough then you have energy to do anything
i think technology has a negative impact on people 's health because we always overuse the computer or smartphone it can harm our eyes our sight
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries because it can give me an opportunity to study other traditions and cultures and also i can meet other people that i can communicate with to improve my foreign language skills
i enjoy spending my free time with my friends in the school stadium we can play all kinds of sports out there such as ping pong racing and basketball which will give us healthier bodies and a fun time
i think the best way for me to improve my english is to read aloud and watch some english movies reading aloud will lead me to have good pronunciation
i 'm learning a new skill playing piano which is a popular and enjoyable skill around the world
it is very common that all university students do part time jobs while they 're studying and there are many advantages for example they can make friends with each other when they are working and they can also learn many practical skills which might be used in the near future and as for the disadvantages i think they will find it hard to strike a balance between their part time jobs and their studies and in my opinion i think all university students should do part time jobs and they can do this to improve their abilities working with each other
hello i am giving a presentation about acid rain firstly there are many cars and factories that generate some pollution like smoke and acid particles are in the smoke as the smoke is carried by the wind the acid particles will divide into two parts some acid particles will fall as dust and damage lakes and other acid particles will mix with cloud water and then they will be in rain or snow and that would do great damage to the environment
well i suggest they can eat more vegetables and fruits because they contain more nutrients than meat and junk food and this will lead to better health and stronger bodies
so i think drinking water can keep us alive and give us a clear mind in the daytime
i think it is quite essential to do exercise every day because this can improve our health and give us stronger bodies to connect with each other you can do exercise with other people who share the same interest in sport
i think that an eight hour sleep at night can give us a clear mind in the daytime
well i think technology has a positive impact on people 's health because it can give us some treatments correctly and it can also provide some ways to improve our health scientifically
i like to communicate and to get to know new places that 's why i 'm interested in getting to know other cultures and other languages
i like doing some sport and to walk and talk to my friends and to play with my children
the best way to improve my english is to completely immerse myself in english i want to say speak all the time in english listen to the radio or the t v in english and write in english too
i would like to fly like a bird because if you are in the sky flying you can see everything from another point of view and that is fantastic
because that way they can have more money more cash and they depend less on their parents a disadvantage of working during university is that they will have less free time to enjoy life in my opinion it 's good to have a part time job but not all the time
when the vehicles and the factories are working there 's a lot of pollution and they emit smoke with contaminant particles that are carried and mixed in the wind and some of them come back to the earth falling down as contamination and the others are mixed with the clouds when the particles are mixed with the cloud they produce rain and this water has a lot of acid particles and causes damage to the environment
to have good eating habits it 's good to eat several kinds of fruits less meat and more vegetables and less sugar
it is very important to drink water you need to drink water and not other drinks like soft drinks or alcoholic drinks because they have a lot of sugar
yes it is i do exercise every day and i think it is a good habit because you wake up your body and you are healthier
the number of hours sleeping depends on every person each person is different
but usually technology is bad because it provokes a sedentary life
when i am on holiday i like to go out with my family
i am usually with my brother my brother and his family are great fun
speaking about all students getting jobs to pay for their studies one of the advantages could be that they can get experience of working talking about disadvantages i think that if they work maybe they have n't got enough time to study but in my own opinion if they can do both things it is good
i 'm going to explain how to travel by airplane first we must go to the airport to go to the airport we can go by bus train or car in the airport the first thing that we have to do is the check in once we check in we must pass document control and security and then we have to stay waiting in the waiting area we have restaurants toilets shops and cafés so we can have something to eat after that they will call us to board so then we will go on our flight
yes i prefer face to face to online learning because with face to face the relationship is better
personally i like working on group projects because we can share different knowledge and we can speak to each other
yes i think that attending lectures is more interesting because the speakers give us their knowledge
having modern learning facilities is interesting for the university because this way the university will reach a good level
i live in a place that is a big house with a large garden
normally i prefer to do some indoor sports such as pilates yoga meditation beside that i will pick up a book from my bookshelf to read such as a comic book or a military book
wow i would like to say that it is my mother because both of us have quite similar personalities we are gorgeous confident
well there are a lot of jobs i would like to do
to say that they can compete with their friends in the near future
today i 'm going to introduce several steps for travelling by airplane first you need to travel to the airport by public transportation or your private car after that you need to have your documents checked by the staff they will check all the details and your identity following this there is a security check they might check your personal belongings and your pockets and so on when you are done with all those things you might need to wait at your correct gate and sit or go to the toilet or shop finally you go on board and your flight takes off
for university students they might use google scholar to do their literature review besides that they might use zoom or teams to ask their professors some questions and also have effective conversations with their classmates
it is clear for normal students face to face tecahing of course guides them to be disciplined and also to be effective but for the students who are geniuses studying alone is a much better way for them
well firstly they will learn how to negotiate and cooperate with other team members in addition they might study how to manage their personality properly because there are many different views in teams
i have to say it is a hundred percent significant for universities to do so because right now artificial intelligence is very modern and popular among students
i am very interested because i want to travel to other countries and find out about their culture and traditions and i want to speak with people in this language because it 's the most widely spoken language in the world
i go with my friends and family to concerts museums and maybe go for a swim or go to a coffee shop just to talk and have some fun but most of the time i 'm just in my house
i watch movies read books and listen to music in english and i visit sites like this like write and improve and speak and improve to improve my english
i would choose to learn better and faster without any problems and to keep any information in my head and share it with others
the advantages are that the students can learn more about their work but at the same time they can earn or make more money while they are studying and the disadvantages are that they wo n't have a lot of time to work and study if they can not balance their job and studies and so they need some free time to do a lot of other things and in my opinion they need to work and organise their time to work and study at the same time without any problems and then they can learn and improve their job and study time
this is an image of the environment as we can see factories and vehicles create pollution that becomes acid particles in the smoke other acid particles mix with clouds in winter and those fall in rain and snow
i think eating habits are important to have a healthy life i think that the most important thing is to eat fruit and vegetables that make you feel more comfortable with yourself and your body
it 's very important to drink water because you can clean your body and you need to do it every single day
yes i think doing exercise is very important because it makes your body stronger you can do any exercise like swimming or football or tennis or any exercise you want but it 's very important to do it regularly
you need to sleep eight hours per day and if you do n't you 're going to be weaker
yeah i think both are correct technology brings you information that is very important to have a healthy life but also you can find fake news that could be dangerous for us
i 'm really interested in the environment in my opinion it 's really important for our future
learn about circuits and play video games and see some movies at the cinema
i mean my father is the most similar to me and he 's tall same as me and has the same skin
i 'm in madrid spain it 's a really wonderful city
all students can do fitness classes can do some exercise
hi everyone in the first place bees collect nectar from flowers then bees make honey from nectar in beehives and then beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives and finally the honey is in a supermarket for all the consumers
i mean the most important thing when choosing a country is the distance between where you live and the school or the university and how much you pay to live there
i mean the cost of the living the culture and the people in the other country are usually different
i do n't know i mean it depends in some cases on the person it is different for everyone
it 's important to know about the culture and how people live in other areas for me it 's nice to get to know the people
watching t v and movies and practising with other people in other countries so when i have the opportunity to practice with other people for my job i take it
maybe the student needs to know about the work
factories start their production and produce pollution and these particles are in smoke after the acid particles have been carried by wind maybe these mix with the cloud and precipitation
eating habits are important because normally people eat badly and do n't eat vegetables only bad food
yes but never practice exercise every day i try to run every day but it is not easy for me
yeah normal people everyone says you need eight hours of sleep
i think that there are many different reasons for learning about other countries but i think that the main reasons are the language and the culture that you can learn about
in my free time i really enjoy reading textbooks about philosophy and about science like physics and also of course i like to hang out with friends
i would say that the best way to improve my english is speaking speaking with friends and with people that can only speak english
i would definitely learn to play an instrument i really like the guitar and i would like to perform my favourite songs by pink floyd and other rock groups
well i would say that the advantages are very clear i think that the students that have to work they have more money and in this way they do n't have to depend on their parents the disadvantage i think is that they have less time to rest and to hang out with friends or something like that in my opinion i would say that each person has to do what they want in this case i think that it is possible to do the two things at the same time so i do n't see a problem
the first step in the production of acid rain is the pollution that comes from factories and vehicles in that situation some acid particles fall as dust contaminating lakes and other acid particles mix with clouds and fall in the form of water damaging the trees and the environment
my advice is that people have to control their diet
i think that drinking water is fundamental not only for keeping a healthy lifestyle but it is fundamental for life
obviously i think that it is not essential to do exercise every day but i think that it is very important that you do exercise as often as you can
yes i agree with that because sleeping well is essential to be rested during your day and to be at your best at work and with your family
i think that technology has neither positive nor negative consequences in our life i think that all these questions depend on each person 's use of technology
i 'm very interested
i like to read books
practising speaking more
to speak english
actually this is a complicated topic because of course you can find advantages and disadvantages the advantage is that the student can get some experience in the time that he 's studying but the disadvantage from my point of view it 's that maybe this person can lose their focus on their studies so this could be complicated
i do not have huge experience regarding acid rain however from what i can see from the picture i can understand that pollution comes from vehicles and factories it goes up in the air and it could be carried by the wind so part of these particles will fall as dust directly in the environment nearby and part of these can be mixed with the cloud water and then that 's the way acid rain is formed so this could damage the environment a little bit more than when it 's carried just as dust
the advice that i can give the people who want to have better eating habits is that they should increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that they are eating and reduce the amount of sugar
yes i do believe that doing exercise daily is a way to improve your health not just your physical health but also your mental health so for me that 's something everyone should do on a daily basis
i think that in my case for example i do need eight hours of sleep every night however maybe there are people who need less and i think it 's fine i think that people should sleep as much as they need
i think with technology it like depends on the way that people are using technology i mean everything in life needs balance and that includes technology
well i 'm pretty interested in learning about other countries about different cultures and the different traditions that they have there
i do n't have that much free time but i like to spend it with my friends and family loved ones in general and i really like to you know read books and that
and also i would say watching movies and t v series really helps me to improve my english and also reading books helps me and watching different videos on youtube
i would really like to play a new instrument i play two instruments right now and i would like to start a new one it 's a traditional persian instrument
well the advantage of students working is that they could have some extra money for what they need and it will help them with money but the disadvantages are that they would have less time for example to do their homework or they would be tired at the end of the day and they will have less energy to do their homework and study for their university course
well this is a diagram that shows how factories and vehicles can cause damage to the environment first of all they make this pollution which has acid particles in the smoke and the wind can carry these acid particles through the air and some of these particles fall down as dust and may pollute the water and some others will go through the clouds and will make acidic water which comes down to the ground as rain or snow
i would definitely tell people do not skip breakfast do not start your day without having your breakfast and also i could say that they should eat more fruits and vegetables and also less sugar
well it 's really important to drink enough water because it really affects our body and our brain in particular you need to drink a glass of water in the morning coz you wake up really dehydrated after sleep
well doing exercise is really important but i do n't think that it 's so necessary to do it every day but it would be really nice if you take exercise like three days a week or more or less however much you can with your lifestyle
well i agree with them scientific research shows that it 's really necessary for our brain to have that sleep overnight it 's really necessary for its functioning
i ca n't give you a firm answer like yes or no but technology has an affect on our lifestyles in many ways it has some benefits and some disadvantages you should know how to manage it
i am really interested because i would like to travel for some months and it 's important for me to know other languages to know other cultures and what is important for other countries
in my free time i usually play guitar and piano and also i like to read books and another important activity is to walk and go running with my dogs
so it 's important to know their expressions or the sound when they talk
i would like to learn about chemistry i think it 's important to know about what happens around us
having a part time job while you 're studying can have some advantages like for example with that salary you can pay for your studies or for example your future studies but also that can have a lot of disadvantages like for example you do n't have enough time to do your homework or you do n't have enough time to spend with your family or with friends or for example to do other kinds of activities you ca n't focus on studying and maybe you can miss out on the opportunity to study
pollution can turn into acid particles and they are in the air these particles travel in the air and in the wind and can convert into acid particles that fall in the dust or another kind of particle that can be in the snow and the rain that kind of particle can fall in the forest and damage the environment
some advice that i can give you is to avoid fast food and you can eat other kinds of foods like for example vegetables fruits that can have a good percentage of water in them
well there 's a high percentage of water in our bodies so it 's important that our body is hydrated to do the different activities throughout the day
not every day i think that doing exercise some days a week is essential to have a healthy lifestyle because the body needs to move the muscles need movement
i think that sleeping is necessary i do n't know because you feel tired all day
well in a positive way i can say that industries are developing new machines and new technology all the time for health
yeah i 'm living in the halls of our university which is two person rooms and currently i just live near my university which is really convenient for me to go to school and to the class and also it 's very convenient to go to work
i 'm really just spending time with my boyfriend during the weekend and weekdays because he is a really good man who can keep me really relaxed and also i 'd like to say that he 's the best one
and i want to be that because i 'm majoring in management science which is in the college of business and i 'm a business student and i want to be a banker
many students get jobs to pay for their university studies and the advantage of this is that if they do this they can improve their work experience and they can get a much better position if they graduate from school and join the company and the other advantage is that if they do this they can earn a lot of money and it can ease the pressure on their finances so they can pay more attention to their subject and the disadvantage is that if they spend a lot of time on getting their jobs they will have less time to spend on their studies and work on their major and in my opinion it 's not good to get jobs to pay for their university studies because it can keep them from studying well
you should travel to the airport by car by bus or by underground and you should get to the departures area and check in if you see the assistant then next step is that you can wait in the departure area there are cafes and a shopping centre also toilets and restaurants are there and when you hear the announcement to board you should go to the gate and board the airplane and the next step you can leave
i consider learning with teachers face to face is the best way because they can communicate with the other people face to face and the students can see their gestures and also their facial expressions
they can learn to express themselves with facial expressions and also their body language
i think that it is of great importance to build learning facilities because it means the students can freely use the learning facilities and enrich their experience by learning by themselves which can help them to get a better job after graduation
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries
i like watching series and searching about how i can speak english very well
practicing and speaking it with someone else watching series with english subtitles and learning new vocabulary and talking to people and listening to everything in english
the advantage of part time jobs for students while they are studying is they can have money to pay the fees of their university the disadvantage is they ca n't have enough time to study but in my opinion they should have a part time job to have the new experience and money to pay for their studies
i will talk about acid rain then this will be carried by the wind then some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water then this acid will be in rain or snow when this falls to the earth it will damage the environment that 's it
my advice is they should search for healthy food and put it in their fridge all the time so they will have healthy eating habits
it 's very important to drink lots of water for their body and their skin to have a healthy lifestyle water is a very important thing
in my opinion it is not important to do exercise every day it 's enough to do exercise three days a week that 's it that 's my opinion
i agree with that opinion because our bodies need eight hours a day to wake up in the morning with a healthy body
i think that technology has generally a positive effect on people 's health because they can use it to affect their lifestyle to make it more healthy
it is in the province of buenos aires in argentina
i enjoy swimming walking on the beach or walking around mountains or sometimes i read or take a walk around the city
it 's my wife of course
i would like to be a developer i am studying for this in a course on my computer
the advantages are you acquire experience you earn your own money and you know the real world the experience is for me very important in this stage of your life the disadvantages are that you have less time to study you can feel tired doing both studying and working and you have more responsibilities in my opinion it is positive because it is a transition from another way of life it is useful when looking for a job when you finish your degree i think you have to do this
well the first thing you have to do when you 're travelling by airplane is to go to the airport by taxi or a bus or train you have to check in at the customer services office and give them your ticket then you have to pass immigration you have to show your document and then pass security they check all your bags everything you have to put in them then you have to wait for the departure at the gate they indicated to you and then board the plane and it flies
students can use technology to look up articles and new discoveries about their studies it 's useful to do it
i think so face to face is the logical way to study and the teacher can correct you at the time and they can find a way for you to study better
working on group projects is how you work in real life when you have to develop some part of a project it 's how you acquire more information and it 's better for you
i think reading alone it 's better because you can reread what you are reading and you can investigate on the web what you are reading
it 's very important today because facilities are improving day by day and you have to know about new technologies for learning
i am very much interested in learning about other countries
i enjoy my free time by watching netflix
i want to speak as much as i can so that i can improve my english
i want to do a master 's in english literature so that i can speak and listen and write very well and even teach other people
in my opinion university students should do part time jobs while they 're studying but some students just want to study they do n't want to do part time jobs and the advantages are they can save more money for their future and for their future studies and sometimes there are like disadvantages because they do n't find much time to do their studies and in my opinion doing a job while studying is very beneficial and it also motivates the student and also boosts the student 's level and he or she feels more independent
as we can see acid rain is very dangerous because it causes air pollution through vehicles and you can see some of the acid particles are carried away in the smoke so it is very bad for nature
they have to avoid that
drinking lots of water increases your immunity it even makes the skin glow and you can feel much more energetic and it will also maintain your water level in your body so drinking water is very beneficial to your health
yes it is essential to do some basic exercises because by doing some kind of fitness exercises everyone can feel energetic happy and the body will be flexible all day
yes in my opinion also sleeping eight hours is a very good hobby or it 's a very good thing and everyone should get this amount of sleep
technology is always a good thing because if we learn about the different technologies we are increasing our economic growth also and through technologies we can easily talk to each other so it 's a good thing but only if we use it in a good manner
well i 'm interested in culture and language and traditions and people in general
well i really really really like watching movies or series i like k dramas i like k series and sometimes i read books
well actually watching movies or series in english to practice
i would like someday to learn to speak korean but i need to learn english first because most of the materials are in english so i need to learn english
first of all i think that i am an expert in this topic because i have a friend who does part time jobs and she is studying right now so i 'll say what she finds difficult about doing part time jobs while you 're a student and what is the advantage i think that one advantage it 's that you have more money to pay for your studies but what is the disadvantage that you do n't have enough time to focus on your studies so it 's difficult and in my opinion i think that it 's not a good idea to find or search for part time jobs while you are a student because you have to focus on your studies right now
pollution is a serious problem in our world and the worst part is that we are part of this because all the pollution begins in factories or vehicles so they have two steps one of them is some acid particles fall as a dust over lakes and seas and other acid particles mix with cloud water and acid particles are rain or snow and they 're so bad for our planet
actually i 'm not the right person to give advice on eating habits to other people because i think that i do n't have good habits with food but i think that one piece of advice is that you should eat a balanced diet
it 's very very important to drink water all day because our brain needs water to work well
well i think not every day because it 's too much yeah it 's important to do exercise some days of the week like three or two or four days of the week
i think that it 's fifty fifty because technology has good things but i think it has bad things too
it could be a good plan for me maybe in the future
i enjoy spending my free time reading i like to read novels especially i like to visit my parents and spend my time with my family and you know with friends and maybe watch some series and listen to music
the best way for me to improve my english is reading i think reading is the best way or listening is a good way too watching some series and obviously like trying to do this speaking with a different person even when it is a robot
it would be painting i love painting frames but i 'm not as good as an artist but i like like the different colors painting i would love to do it and improve those skills i think it 's artistic it could be an excellent skill to have
in my view the advantage for students of doing part time jobs is that they have their money to do many things or maybe buy commodities i do n't know to pay for those that is important because you know that students most of the time run out of money and they need to buy their own clothes or maybe other things that they need the disadvantage is that they worry about many things like working earning money doing many things and not investing time and preparing themselves to maybe get that degree or something related to that that is my opinion but i think it 's important to get like experience that is a really important part
this is my presentation about acid rain and at the beginning acid rain is produced by factories and vehicles the wind moves these acid particles or these acid particles are carried by wind some of these fall as dust and others mix with water in the clouds for example and the situation is this acid rain moves over the world and the atmosphere with the wind for example and then it falls down as rain you know or snow and that could damage the environment that is the situation
thinking about what they are eating is the most important thing you know like the quantity of the food it is important to create this kind of healthy habit
it is really important as far as i know people should drink like two litres of water per day i do n't like drinking too much water but i know that is necessary to moisturise your skin and everything
from my point of view doing exercise like three times per week will be enough according to many specialists that will be good for your muscles and it will be good to keep moving your body just that
i think that is correct you have to sleep at least eight hours as an adult person because that is the time when your body recovers from many things even some illnesses or maybe stress are caused by people not sleeping very well
i think it could be both you know that would be good but on the other hand it could be negative
i enjoy reading watching t v series and thinking in my free time
nowadays university students should do part time jobs while they study they 're learning their own subject the advantages are students have money from doing part time jobs
today i would like to talk about acid rain first acid rain comes from pollution and acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water and then acid particles are in rain and snow so acid particles fall on the earth the environment the trees and the trees and the environment are damaged
oh drinking water is vital to our lives drinking water is so good
doing exercise is good if you do n't do exercise you ca n't have a healthy heart
everyone sleeps usually for seven hours or eight hours a day
technology has pros and cons
i have always enjoyed playing football however now i 'm thinking of taking up volleyball in the holidays
i like spending time with my sister because she is similar to me we always play football together and we have a great time together
in the future i would like to be an auditor because i 'm studying business i am a lover of business so i think it could be my dream job
it is a good question and it has got a lot of advantages for example they can earn money to spend on their activities or hobbies they are able to work furthermore they can know all about the job however they could lose a lot of time furthermore they would n't be able to study and they would n't have any free time for this reason i believe that parents must pay for the university studies of their children because i think they have got this obligation
hi first of all we must travel to the airport by car or by bus or by train when we arrive at the airport we must do the check in we must show our documents to the police and next we must pass the security control
students could use technology in different ways for example they can search a lot of information to study
i love working in a group project because we can learn how to work in a team furthermore we can improve our relationship with our classmates
it is a good question but i believe that it depends on the person on the one hand some people prefer attending lectures on the other hand some people prefer to read alone
i think that schools with modern facilities their students will learn faster than those in other schools without these facilities
i love travelling and learning new things so maybe a hundred percent i 'd say
i also write blogs and articles
i need to be immersed in english for example by reading or listening and also speaking in english
definitely my communication skill because i 'm quite insecure about my speaking skill so i want to improve that especially my english speaking skill
i have nothing against university students doing part time jobs actually it 's very good for them and the disadvantages of course most of them do n't have enough time to study or to sleep and to rest well so in my own opinion it 's an advantage it 's like a ninety percent advantage and a ten percent disadvantage
smoke from vehicles and factories is the most common factor or contributor to air pollution then in the smoke there are acid particles and of course when it is carried by the wind some of the acid particles fall as dust and this also contributes to the pollution of the environment and that is how acid rain is created
people who want to develop good eating habits should first have self discipline and be consistent in their plan about eating healthy foods avoid eating salty foods junk food and try eating more vegetables especially the green ones
drinking lots of water gives us a lot of benefits it 's very beneficial for our body because it cleanses the toxins and unnecessary you know toxins in our body
most people do n't have time to exercise regularly every day but doing exercise more frequently can help our body to become strong and our bones to be stronger and more flexible
eight hours of sleep every night is actually a good sleep
it really depends on the usage of technology because nowadays technology is also used for medical purposes
i am so interested because travel is one of my favourite hobbies
in my free time i usually practice sports and during the weekend i go out with my friends sometimes to the cinema or sometimes to have dinner
i think that it 's a strange thing that i have n't got this capacity and if i could i would
the advantage of having a part time job is that you do n't depend on your parents to give you money and a very big disadvantage is that you have less time to study or do things of interest
and acid particles are in the air and wind will move them
having good eating habits makes your health improve
water is the only drink people must drink so the more water you drink the better health you will have
in my personal case i practice sport five or six days a week so if i were them i would do some exercise at least three or four times a week
i think that is an unbelievable amount in my case i sleep from six to seven hours and i rest
i think that there has to be a balance because it has its good things and bad things for example take phones
on holidays i like to spend my time running and doing some cooking and cleaning my rooms and doing the laundry
oh it 's a difficult question but my wife is the person that i most love to spend time with
and that 's it
okay let me explain about the jobs all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies and secondly the disadvantage of that activity is they will have less time to study at their university so all students have to do jobs to some extent to pay for their university studies at least partially not everything
so the first thing you have to do is to travel to the airport by car or bus or public transportation to reach the airport after getting to the airport you have to go to the check in counter to check in at the counter and then go to security with your hand luggage and other things and after security you 're going to wait for some minutes or some hours before boarding the plane and after boarding the plane the plane will go to your destination
technology can help you to study more effectively
i agree with this opinion too
i think communication skills and the motivation skills will be developed through group projects
i m my opinion attending lectures is important and more effective for studying because attending lectures you can communicate with teachers and your colleagues in the class
i enjoy playing with my son and watching t v or looking at the social networks and studying english
i think the best way is to practice every day the language and grammar and watch videos in english
i think the advantage is about the responsibilities because the students develop new skills in the workplace in my opinion it is necessary for the students to learn to balance both areas studies and jobs because they will have experience of work but are students
the environmental pollution is a consequence of the different pollution sources such as factories vehicles and we humans the pollution produces acid rain and there are consequently particulates acid particulates in the wind the acid rain affects the plants water and the quality of life of humans animals and other species on earth
i think a workout is fundamental for healthy living but i think the body needs a rest sometimes but doing exercise is important
i think that is true but sometimes it is difficult to sleep seven or eight hours at night but it is true
it depends on the use but fundamentally it 's positive
i am very very interested in learning about other countries and cultures
in my free time i like to watch movies read some books go to the beach go to the park with my daughters
i think the best way to improve my english is speaking and learning all about the grammar and trying to speak with other people
at this moment i 'm trying to learn to be a pilot
in my opinion there are no disadvantages to working part time while studying in university
to begin with we can see in these pictures vehicles and factories emitting carbon dioxide causing pollution and emitting acid particles in smoke these acid particles are carried by wind and some acid particles go down as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water then the acid particles go down in rain or snow and cause damage to the environment
for the people who want to develop good eating habits the first thing to do is forget the junk food it is the worst thing for the human body
it is very very important to drink water all day long because all of our systems our body systems need water to work in the correct way
of course doing exercise is very important for maintaining the health of your body but doing exercise every day could be very difficult for some people
there is no magic number of hours of sleep every day what you have to understand is each person has their personal amount of time to sleep and feel healthy the next day
there are many ways to think about this question in one way technology has improved health treatments
i find it very interesting to know about their culture or their architecture and i enjoy travelling to other countries
i enjoy my free time with my cat also i design some clothes and make these clothes using crochet
in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing with other people that know the language also i believe that writing and reading some texts is useful
i would learn about the grammar and also i would like feel more comfortable when i 've improved my english
but it has actually some disadvantages such as the loss of leisure time free time for our friends or something like that
this is a presentation about an actual issue that is the formation of acid rain it is caused by vehicles or factories then in the third step these acid particles are carried by wind and in this part we have two options first some acid particles fall as dust but other particles mix with cloud water therefore these acid particles are in rain or snow and it causes damage to our environment this is an important issue and actually is the most important
in my opinion having a good lifestyle starts with our eating habits so personally i could say that consulting a specialist is the best way to start with these good eating habits
as far as i know experts recommend that in our daily routine we should drink a minimum of two litres of water
yeah in my opinion exercise is the best way to keep healthy doing exercise has a lot of advantages such as losing weight as well as keeping a good lifestyle
as far as i know experts recommend that having about six to eight hours of sleep is enough
in my opinion currently technology is part of our daily routine so personally i would like to say that technology has a positive effect on society 's development
i like to play some games i like to watch movies i like to go to the gym
but the one disadvantage is about time you do n't have much time to dedicate yourself to studying to improve yourself you know my personal opinion about it is if you do n't need to do a part time job you know i think it 's good to focus on your studies
hey everyone i will go ahead with my presentation about acid rain and i will show the diagram about it first it starts with pollution this pollution comes from vehicles and factories and then the particles are from pollution and then they 're carried by wind it damages all the environment
good advice about eating habits is to transform your own life into a more healthy one and consequently life is good because good eating habits are essential for human lives
absolutely doing exercise every day is essential for humans it 's the same as eating and drink water programmatically but doing exercise is one of the most important things to do now in life
i think technology is a good ally because it helps us to do great things like drinking sleeping and doing exercise for a good healthy lifestyle you know so i think it 's good
i think that the environment is the most important thing in the world and i always participate in some activities to protect our environment
on the weekend we enjoy playing badminton together because this sport not only exercises our bodies but also we have a good time there and i am good at playing badminton
i think it 's my mom we both have big eyes and it 's not only our appearance but also we are very friendly and patient in doing everything
i want to live in hong kong in the future because hong kong is an open and inclusive city and i will get a well paid job there
now i 'm going to talk about students doing fitness classes in college but the disadvantages are obvious too first some students may not be suitable for these fitness classes because they have a weak body and then they will get hurt in the fitness classes so in my opinion i recommend fitness classes in colleges because nowadays the students need to get more and more exercise in their schools
today i 'm going to talk about how honey is produced first of all the bees will collect nectar from flowers then in the beehives the bees make honey from nectar together when the honey is formed the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives then the beekeepers will pour the honey into bottles then after that there are some vehicles that transport the bottles of honey to the shops finally in the shops they will give them a price and put them onto the shelves so we can buy them
in my opinion they should consider the fees when studying abroad and the economic level because money is the most important thing and the locals ' different culture is important too
i think having a good command of a second language will help you have better communication with other people in their countries and when you are in different countries you will speak easily to other people
in my opinion the most difficult thing is the local language because it is not the mother tongue for most students studying abroad and the second one is the different local culture it 's very different from ours
i think they can learn about the local culture by reading some books which are about local history and they can also go on the internet and search for some information about the history
i agree with them because when you study abroad just by yourself you will learn many life skills which can help you become more independent and you will not depend too much on your parents for money and anything else
i think the best way to learn english is by listening to broadway musicals it is important to listen to music but i think broadway musicals can use difficult structures that you can imitate so you could improve
i think that i would like to learn how to drive because in my town there 's a lot of traffic so it is difficult to move from one place to another one so for example i 'm not ready to work for that reason because i live far from other places
i think that part time jobs are a good idea so students at university could learn new skills that they could n't learn in the school so for example i think some areas of those advantages are you could communicate better and you have confidence when you give a presentation on the other hand some disadvantages are that you are busier and you do n't have time free time you can spend on social things but in my opinion it 's important to have a balance in your life
the smoke of those gases could be mixed with acid particles and those acid particles can be carried by the wind and in the wind the particles can fall as dust and other ones could be mixed with the cloud and the clouds are water i could say that but the dreadful part of it being mixed with the clouds is that the rain and the snow could fall as acid rain
i am not a nutritionist but i could tell you that it 's important to have a balance when you 're eating you have to eat meat fish or something that can bring you protein and you also have to eat fruits and vegetables and preferably you have to eat dishes of different colours
i am not sure at all but i think that the minimum that you have to drink is three liters of water but if you are a sports trainer you have to drink more than three liters of water because it will be affect your brain or your training if you do n't drink
i think that it 's important to do exercise and also it 's important to organise your schedule for example you have to do minimum three hours per week
that 's true it 's important to sleep eight hours
i do n't think that technology is a problem but some people think that it is because you have to organise your schedule also when you 're napping or doing exercise
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries
watching a movie
speaking with native speakers who can correct my mistakes
all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying what are the advantages disvantages and what is your own opinion yeah advantages are that they can earn for their uni fees and that they are well fed and my own opinion is that they can do the part time jobs while they are studying hard
and these acid particles are in the smoke and then they are blown in the skies by the wind and the acid particles are carried by the wind so we need to review the factories ' and vehicles ' pollution
for good eating habits they need to eat healthy food and not fast food it contains a lot of salt and fat and they need to avoid it
of course doing exercise every day for at least half an hour to an hour is quite important for the human body
yeah and eight hours ' sleep is essential for every human being and if they can have some sleep they can restore their energy and they 're refreshed for the next day for their physical exercise or mental activity
besides it has a great view since i live near an old lake with animals such as ducks turtles and fish
as soon as i am on vacation i take a break and always go to the beach with my family it 's wonderful to have quality time with your loved ones also i really enjoy swimming in the sea
i love to hang out with her because i like to teach her good things besides we both love animals i hope that in the future she and i have the same relationship
after finishing my degree in biotechnology i would like to work in a laboratory or in a research centre
i will talk about a special topic the topic is all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies well from my point of view this has many advantages what 's more the student will become more independent about the disadvantages maybe the student wo n't have time for other activities it 's ok is for a good reason and in my opinion i think it 's a good opportunity for all the students it 's great
first of all you need transport to travel to the airport for example in a taxi in a car on a train or on a bus i do n't know the important thing is that you arrive at the airport then the employee is going to check your passport and another man is going to check your documents this is for the security control after that you must wait in the hall while you wait you can have a coffee eat go to the bathroom you pass the time before you go to board the airplane
currently technology is very important for life because with technology you can learn about different topics
well in my point of view i think the best way to learn for me is face to face
well speaking is an advantage
yeah of course
i am really interested in other countries each country has their own kinds of food or buildings and i think it 's so interesting
i like to play video games and meet up with friends
the best way to improve your english is to practice a lot
i would like to learn about karate it 's a really interesting sport and can help you in difficult situations where you need to defend yourself
working while studying is a common decision all students have to consider once at least in their lives on the one hand your university degree can be very expensive and that 's why working while studying could be really useful for people but on the other hand it could take too much time and you could not have enough time to prepare well for your exams so i think the most important thing is to prepare your studies well and leave work for later for the future
nowadays air pollution is such a very important problem in our society and the smoke they produce contains acid particles that are spread by the wind then some of them fall contaminating our lakes and rivers and some others mix with cloud water and when it rains they fall onto our forests damaging our environment
my advice is to reduce their consumption of fast food and start to eat five meals per day it is very important to obtain strength for their bodies
it is very important to drink lots of water our bodies are composed of about ninety percent water so we need to drink a lot in order to be healthy
absolutely doing exercise every day reduces our possibilities of having a disease and makes us gain some strength and exercise our bodies
it is very very important to sleep eight hours every day our body needs to rest a long time in order to be able to do its best in our daily life
that is a difficult question on the one hand it has improved our lives allowing us to communicate in every situation
it is quite awesome so it is quite peaceful here
i have got three daughters
i would like to be a teacher because i like spending time with children
all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies there are some advantages to this secondly they will get some experience which will help them in their future career on the other hand they will spend some time on their work as a result they will have less time for their studies in my opinion it is quite a good idea for students to get a job to pay for their university studies because they will be more experienced
i have been asked to give a presentation about travelling by airplane so look at this diagram to start with go to the check in where your luggage will be weighed and you will have your boarding pass then go to the document control and to the security if you have done all this and you have time wait in the cafe or go to the restroom or go to the duty free to buy presents after that go to board and enjoy your flight
to study more effectively students can use technology they can search for additional information and also they can read different research about this topic
i think that students can develop cooperation and communication skills when working together on group projects because they have to listen to each other
i do n't think that attending lectures is more useful than learning alone you can do this online by yourself and it will be as good as attending lectures if you do it responsibly
i think that it is very important to provide modern learning facilities in universities because nowadays in the world of high technology it is so important to have modern equipment
i 'm interested in culture language and food i 'm interested
i spend my free time doing some exercise or reading some books for example i like it
first of all the infographic shows us about acid rain and then the wind transports these particles inside the clouds polluting them and then when it rains or snows the particles are in rain or snow and fall on trees
for me it is very important that you should drink water about two or three liters per day
in my opinion it is very important to do exercise every day but perhaps to rest one day but doing exercise about six days is very important
i think i agree with the statement it is very important to sleep about eight hours at night then your body is better
i 'm really interested to learn about canada because i moved to canada a few years ago and here there are a lot of people from different cultures and i 'd like to learn a little about each one
i enjoy spending my free time making some cookies and cakes i like to cook a lot and i like to go shopping and i like to go walking too
for me the best way to improve my english is studying a lot i study every single day and to improve my speaking i think i need to speak all the time it 's the best way to improve
if i could learn a new skill i think it would be a language i started to study english because i moved to canada for a few years and i needed to speak english and i have a passion for language
all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying because there are more advantages they gain experience but there are some disadvantages because they do n't have much time to study more
acid rain is caused because factories and vehicles emit some gases and this pollution forms acid particles in smoke and it is transformed into acid particles and carried by wind and some acid particles fall as dust and other acid particles mix with cloud water
it 's very important to drink a lot of water because our body is composed of seven percent water so you need to drink water to hydrate your body it 's very important to drink to have good health
yes it 's really important to do exercise every single day
some researches show that it 's very important to sleep at least eight hours per day
i 'm very interested in learning about other countries because they have different cultures and different customs and i think it 's very helpful to know this and practice their customs there
some days i spend my time reading books and watching series and anime this is because that strengthens me in my language in my vocabulary in english spanish and japanese
i improve my english by doing many exercises and doing the homework reading different texts like magazines and books and watching series
and you can communicate the feelings or thoughts you have
all university students should do part time jobs well it 's a big discussion because the advantages are many some of them are the student will have extra money and experience of their job so they can be responsible and honest but the disadvantage of this they do n't have enough time to study for their exams and do the homework in my opinion if you do n't have enough time it 's necessary to organise and try to do work try to give the best of yourself it 's the best answer in your life as a student
this is because factories and vehicles produce pollution one group mixes with cloud water and the other group falls as dust the clouds rain or snow over the environment that causes a deterioration in the life in that area and produces contamination
y to have good eating habits you need to divide up the hours in the day and go to the nutritionist or doctor they will give you their best plan for this and will help you
for our body it is important to drink water because our body consists of seventy percent water and if you need a healthily lifestyle you need to drink more water
maybe one person sleeps five hours and the other seven hours
i think excess is bad but if you want to use the technology of your site it 's good
i 'm very interested about learning other countries especially england and the united kingdom
i spend my free time reading cycling doing spinning going to the mountains
i need to improve my spoken english so i am trying to use speaking apps
i d like to improve my spoken english
well i am going to talk about if all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying or not well if you do part time jobs one of the advantages of doing a part time job while you are studying is you can earn money you can help your parents or the people who are paying for your studies
well i 'm going to try to explain how pollution from factories and vehicles causes damage to the environment
well i think we should eat all kinds of foods we should eat not much fat and not many sweets
drinking water is very important to be correctly hydrated so we should drink more water regularly during the day
well i think we should do exercise regularly i do n't think every day but i think twice a week or three times a week or more
i think sleeping seven or eight hours a day is very important to be healthy
i think technology can be bad or good for people it depends on the use people make of technology
i am very interested in the environment and in keeping it in the best condition as possible
we love thrifting and we also love going to get a little drink while we thrift it 's great fun because you can find the most amazing pieces ever and they 're also unique we also love just sitting down just enjoying our time in a park just chatting and catching up with everything
looks wise i think my little sister we look very similar like some people really think that she 's my daughter but personality wise i would say my other younger sister yeah
actually would love to live in the u k for a couple of years and then come back home yeah i truly love spain so
i personally agree with that statement i think the advantage of that is that if the students have no time after school to do any type of sport they get an opportunity to exercise during the day plus it 's very good for students ' health as for the disadvantages i dunno i think that unless somebody has like some sort of physical difficulty that 's the only disadvantage i see and in my opinion that 's great and i think that should be done more it 's perfect
this diagram shows how honey is produced in the first step bees collect nectar from flowers that they find nearby and after that they go to their beehives and they make honey from that nectar that they 've gathered after a while of gathering nectar and transforming it into honey beekeepers collect that honey and they put it into jars and then they ship it to supermarkets where it 's sold to everyone to enjoy
what they should consider is i 'd say the cost of living because if they have enough money to just live without working they would have to find a place that 's low key cheap so they do n't have to work and study at same time
if you study in a second language you learn that language and i think it 's easy enough i 've always done it so yeah
i think what they might find difficult might be the language if they do n't speak it very fluently or maybe making friends or adapting to the country yeah
they can learn it when they 're going outside with friends to like clubs or if they just visit museums or historical sites or just a nice simple restaurant where they serve local food that 's also a really great place where you can learn about the local culture
i think it 's true because it gives you the freedom to do whatever you like and if you make mistakes there is n't really anybody from your family that could help you so it just makes you grow up as a person even if you do n't want to
i am very interested
i spend my free time reading studying english and spanish and planning to travel around the world
speak with other people
so i agree and support this option
first factories produce a lot of pollution and this causes acid particles to be in smoke and these acid particles are carried by wind and the wind makes some particles fall as dust and others mix with cloud water this process forms acid rain and this damages the environment
so i think healthy living is a hard process but i can do this with discipline and share with others that i can do this too
water can help you to think with more clarity and sleep more healthily too so drinking water can be hard but that 's so important
oh it depends depends on the situation but i think that it 's so important really really important doing exercise but not every day
having great quality sleep is most important but eight hours a day that 's hard
that 's a really good question this is an amazing and incredible city every summer it 's crowded with foreign people but in winter it is peaceful there are a lot of palm trees
well that 's an interesting question when i 'm on holiday i always work to earn my own money and i am crazy about playing volleyball with my friends at the beach
well in the future i would like to work as a nurse in london because i think here in spain there are bad conditions and in london the conditions are better
well from my point of view i think there are some advantages to working as a waiter for example while you are studying but i think that there are more disadvantages than advantages for example if you are working you do n't have much time for yourself and for your family or your pets even your friends
i am going to explain what you need to do to travel by airplane first of all you need to go to the airport you can go by car by bus or by train or you can ask someone from your family or your friend to take you to the airport when you arrive at the airport after this you need to check in in the airport later you should pass the document control this is the most difficult task in the airport because there are a lot of people
from my point of view studying face to face is better than studying with technology
as far as i 'm concerned attending lectures alone is better than with other people because you can concentrate on your own better
i think if the university provides learning facilities for the students they could be doing a great favour to students
i 'm quite interested because i use my english for everyday tasks in my job i have to work with people from different countries in europe so that 's why i need to use my english in my job so it 's important for me
i especially enjoy my free time going out with my friends because what i hate the most is loneliness i can not imagine the last days of my life alone
as i said before i have to use my english in my job so that 's the best way of improving my english practicing on my projects because i have to work with people from different countries in europe so i have to improve my english
i am sure that it would be learning chinese because when i have to look for data sheets of products that are sold in china maybe i have to contact chinese people
i am quite sure that students doing part time jobs while they are studying has more pros than cons because you have to spend a lot of your lifetime working so it 's better to understand how enterprises work
hello everybody i 'm here to talk about the acid rain cycle and this cycle begins with factories and vehicles producing pollution when they are working so they create smoke and these acid particles are inside this smoke so that goes up into the sky and creates some clouds mixed with water so when the wind blows it moves these clouds to the forest or to the rural areas and it starts raining so these particles go down with the water and they cause some damage to the environment especially trees and the water in the lakes
i would tell them to create a good schedule for their meals especially when their day starts they have to eat some good sugar and some fat because they need energy for their day
in to my opinion i think everybody should do exercise every day because jobs nowadays are very boring so we are stuck in our chairs and in front of computers
i disagree with this opinion because i think that not everybody needs the same amount of sleeping time because for example i only need six hours seven hours to just be good for my day and not eight hours as i do n't need that
but right now using augmented reality or something like that you can use technology to keep moving
i am extremely interested in learning about other countries
well i think there are different ways to improve my english through watching videos through writing on websites and through daily reading
okay if i had the chance to learn a new skill i would go for learning to cook because i think it would help me in different ways like in my real life and yeah
ok first of all let me talk about the advantages when students do part time jobs they will have enough money they earn enough money for their studies and they can earn enough money you know for things that they can buy and they will also become more responsible they will know how to be a responsible person when doing part time jobs and this also prepares them for life as well however there are some disadvantages to part time jobs as well first of all the students will not have enough time for their studies and for their leisure time but personally i think part time jobs are necessary since they prepare students for their life
ok talking about the diagram we can come to this conclusion that acid rain is exceedingly dangerous for the environment and it is because of pollution and in some parts it falls down to the rivers again and the rest of it is carried to the clouds which eventually become water and it rains onto the environment or onto the ground and it damages the ground because it is polluted and it is not safe for the environment
okay i think they need to have very healthy eating habits like they need to include some vegetables fruits and some you know low fat food in their eating habits
okay naturally it 's very important to drink water since it has a lot of advantages
i totally agree with them because sleeping it is absolutely vital for every person
i think it depends on the people some people use it in a negative way which has negative effects on them however some people use it in a very positive way which has positive impacts on their lifestyle
it is said that it is very important to take the environment into consideration because of the fact that it has a lot of big problems nowadays such as pollution
it is said that friends are a good and important part of your life
although there are some people that say that i 'm more similar to my mother i think that i 'm more similar to my father because we like to do the same things such as watch films or read books
if i had to choose i would choose to live in another country because it 's important to me get experience and know other cultures other languages of other places so if could i would live and work for example in london
it has both pros and cons on the one hand the advantages could be that the students of schools and colleges get or keep fit because of the fact that some scientific studies say that we must obtain some proteins or nutrients for our brain because our brains are working during the day and we need these substances to make a good connection between the brain and our body oh and on the other hand the disadvantages could be that the students have less time to study their units so to sum up in my opinion it 's important to have time for all these types of activities
if you want to know how honey comes from flowers and goes to the shop i 'm going to explain it first of all bees collect nectar from flowers and bees make honey from nectar in beehives so this type of animal is said to be the most important animal on the planet because without them the planet could die secondly the beekeepers collect the honey from beehives in order to put it into a container that is called a jar by the end of the process it will be put into a car and a person will transport these types of containers to a supermarket or a shop and there people can buy this honey and take this food to their homes
if i were them i would choose a country where i could speak the language for example the u s a or london something like that because i could communicate with other people and it 's easier for me and a country where the climate is similar to the country where they come from
first of all the advantage of studying a second language is that you can communicate with other people for example you can travel to more countries because you know another language and you can understand what other people say to you
the difficulty of studying in another country from my point of view is that you do n't have your family near so if you want them near or you need them you can only call them with your mobile phone or something like that
if you study in another country you must go outside and learn about the culture in different ways for example in order to know this type of culture you could visit monuments or churches or take part in festivities
because of the fact that you are abroad from my point of view you become more independent because you have to do everything by yourself you do n't have your family near your friends near so if you want something you have to obtain it alone so this is the reason why you become more independent
i 'm inclined to read novels which can allow me step into the fantastic world that the books provide so when i have free time i like to read novels which can also provide me with a sense of comfort and relaxation
i like to spend time with my husband because we share the same interests for example we like to watch movies we watch movies which can make us feel relaxed so i like to spend leisure time with my husband
i want to be a teacher because i think teaching is a meaningful job just a single word can transform a person 's life
if students want to use technology to study more effectively here are some ways first of all they can use chat g b t to help them to revise their essays
i think if possible students should learn face to face with the teachers here are some reasons
i think if students can work on group projects they can learn communication skills in order to achieve the same goal they should learn how to compromise and communicate with their group 's members
sure it 's a really nice place it has really nice living conditions and it has everything you need from supermarkets to recreational centres
as most of my holidays will be in summer i really like swimming because it 's i think a really enjoyable way to spend my time you know swimming has always been enjoyable so i like doing it
i think i would say my mom because most of our opinions are the same which is why i really like talking to her and i can ask any questions i need and she has information about them
i would like to be a businessman as it 's been my ambition since my childhood to start a business yeah
it 's argued by many people that all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies themselves this has several advantages the main one is that they get the experience of working in a workplace and they have extra pocket money and they do not need to ask their parents for money but doing jobs in their free time may not leave enough time for their university studies which is why i think it 's better for them to get jobs after finishing their degree
people who want to travel by aeroplane need to go through several stages they are first of all they obviously need to travel to the airport and then they go to check in after their documents have been checked and following this they go to security and once they pass security they go to the waiting area there they can have a meal or go to the toilet or something and they finally go on board to get ready for the flight
so i think technology has a good impact on studying
i also think that face to face learning is the best way of studying because the students who are studying face to face will be under supervision because not every student is able to study without supervision
no i do n't think so because attending lectures has always seemed boring to students so i think reading alone can be a much more effective way of studying
i think it 's really important for universities to provide their students with modern learning facilities because if they are not up to date it can have a bad impact on their students ' productivity
well i 'm pretty interested in learning about other countries coz i like travelling so i think learning about other countries gives me a better understanding of other countries ' culture and i 'd like to travel and see other scenery and to make friends from all over the world
well if it is n't raining outside i like to take a walk near the riverbank or just walk the dog
i guess it must be speaking coz you know learning a foreign language and stuff the most important part is speaking coz while you are speaking you may make some mistakes and the process of correcting the mistakes is what helps you to improve yourself a lot
i suppose it might be to learn how to play the piano coz i already know how to play the violin and i really love music and i think playing the piano is very you know very graceful and i think that it must be a wonderful thing
first i 'd like to explain the advantages as we all know doing part time jobs will give us more experience to work in society and you know the university students they are close to becoming members of society and that will give them some money and give them more ways to get the money to pay for their living costs but there are also some disadvantages coz that might be a very distracting thing and maybe the students can be missing out on their social life while they are doing the part time jobs coz they 're still students and they do n't have much social life experience
for pollution to turn into acid rain and end up damaging the environment there are six steps and when the wind blows the acid particles are carried by the wind and then some of them fall as dust and they will contaminate lakes or the soil and other acid particles mix with cloud water which will then turn into rain or snow but in the end they may also fall as dust and they will damage the trees the soil the land or lakes
first of all we need to eat regularly and we need to avoid eating a lot of junk food like hamburgers or eating a lot of sugar or oil
well i think that depends coz we 're not professional sportspeople so i think doing exercise regularly is very important because that will keep us in better shape and make us healthy both physically and mentally i think
well i think that depends you know coz you know the quality of our sleep is the most important thing so i think what is important is to have a great sleep environment not the time we sleep and i think eight hours ' sleep is also a great thing i think
generally speaking i think it 's more positive than negative coz i think nowadays we go to the hospital and we just take some c t or other scientific equipment to test our body cells and that 's very convenient
i love the summer in summer i have holidays and i like the sun and the sea and in the summer it 's easier to see the sea and go to the seaside
it 's very important for me because in my job i must know about the latest news and i love economics and i like to read about economics
i love nature and as a child i walked in nature and in the mountains and i love running too and i love running in the mountains and i can see wild animals
i love my current job but in the future i would like to design new motorbikes for an important motorbike company for example ducati and i would like to buy bikes for myself
it 's good the students can learn a lot of new skills and they can find out what their future jobs will be like but on the other hand the students have little free time and then the students must rest and they must be focusing on their degree it 's a positive idea for me
tunes net began very very badly because on the first day they had twenty thousand visits but they improved because on the seventh day they had one hundred thousand visits on the other hand music now began very very well but they did not improve because on the seventh day they had eighty thousand visitors
and he must have good social skills and he must be a good speaker to communicate his decisions
disagreeing many times is positive because it highlights new solutions and it 's the best way to solve difficult problems
and when the conversation is not face to face it 's more difficult
but for solving difficult problems you need many people
i would love to learn about other countries their traditions their heritage and their cultures also their food habits
i love to spend my free time with my family reading books and swimming
the best way to improve my english speaking skills is by reading english newspapers listening to english news channels and speaking english daily
students studying in universities should do part time jobs the advantages are they can be financially independent they can earn their living there are also disadvantages with part time jobs like not concentrating on their studies however i prefer to work to do part time jobs along with concentrating on my studies
factories and vehicles consume fuels and generate smoke this smoke is called pollution this smoke goes up into the air and this smoke contains acid particles the acid particles are carried by the wind towards the sky a few particles fall back towards the ground as dust and other particles mix with the clouds and fall back to the ground in the form of rainfall or snowfall this rainfall and also snowfall damages the environment
i want to advise the people who are willing to improve their eating habits to eat only green leafy vegetables and fruits and in particular they should avoid junk food
doing exercise every day keeps our body fit
having a sound sleep allows the body to heal any injuries inside the body
technology has both a positive and negative effect on people 's health i recommend people to use technology in a positive way
i live in malaga city it 's a beautiful place with many monuments in the capital city and also downtown and also it has beautiful nature
i enjoying walking in the mountains and also travelling to see some new cities and places i like meeting up with friends too
i enjoy most being with my cousin she is a little talkative but she 's so funny i love going with her to dance
i would like to be a teacher in the future that 's why i am studying english so i can pass an exam and do a master 's degree i 'd love to teach people
the advantage of having a job to pay for your studies is that you can value your studies more than if someone else pays for you but in my opinion it could be a job for a vacation in which you can save money and then enjoy your studies
have you travelled by airplane if not i will tell you how you can do it
using technology for study could be useful when you need to watch a video for example to understand better what you are studying
