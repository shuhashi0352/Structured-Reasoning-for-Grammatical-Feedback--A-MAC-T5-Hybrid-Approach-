SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011  0.00  7.22 <o,Q5,C,P3> having fitness classes is a very important thing
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011  7.22 16.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> students should keep their health and wellness at its best level because they are at the best age for health
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 16.95 28.42 <o,Q5,C,P3> and they have to focus at that age on doing many sports and doing workouts
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 28.42 32.60 <o,Q5,C,P3> actually on the other hand it has some disadvantages
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 32.60 37.27 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you know it might take up their time
SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011 37.27 42.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> you know schools don't have that much time

SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011  0.00  1.86 <o,Q5,C,P4> hello everyone
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011  1.86  8.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> in today's presentation we are going to talk about honey and how it's produced
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011  8.04 18.98 <o,Q5,C,P4> so we are going to tell you how it goes from flowers to your hand and how it's produced
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 18.98 25.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> first bees collect the nectar from flowers
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 25.56 35.74 <o,Q5,C,P4> then they return to the beehives and make the honey using the nectar
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 35.74 43.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> when they are finished beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 43.23 48.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> then that honey is stored in jars
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 48.42 55.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> when it is stored it is shipped to the shops and supermarkets
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 55.14 58.05 <o,Q5,C,P4> this is the journey of the honey
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 58.05 59.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> i hope you enjoyed it
SI114J-00011-P50019 1 SI114J-00011  0.00 12.45 <o,Q5,C,P5> there's no doubt that choosing a country is an essential thing for students in order to decide in which university they want to study
SI114J-00011-P50019 1 SI114J-00011 12.45 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> so first they should consider the safety of the country and the education quality
SI114J-00011-P50021 1 SI114J-00011  0.00  8.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> there is no doubt that the students who want to study abroad would face many difficulties

SI114J-00011-P50022 1 SI114J-00011  0.00 10.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> students have many options in order to learn about the country and the local culture
SI114J-00011-P50022 1 SI114J-00011 10.71 16.35 <o,Q5,C,P5> in my opinion they can go and participate in social events

SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 37.78 54.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and at the same time the disadvantage of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as study time or for learning some other things

SI114J-00045-P50019 1 SI114J-00045  0.00 16.10 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that when a student is choosing a country to go to study there the first thing that they are thinking about is about the quality of the universities

SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045 11.76 19.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time it is a very valuable thing that enterprises value
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045  0.00  6.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that there are a lot of constraints when you're studying in another country
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045  6.79 16.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all you have to learn a new language and speak a new language or your second language

SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045  0.00 11.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything on your own
SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045 11.12 19.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you have to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you don't do when you live at home

SI114J-00057-P10007 1 SI114J-00057  0.00 17.21 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like spending time with all my family with my brothers with my sister with my parents and also with my cousins
SI114J-00057-P10008 1 SI114J-00057  0.00  7.70 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in the future i would like to work in a company called johnson and johnson
SI114J-00057-P10008 1 SI114J-00057  7.70 17.73 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i would like the position of the senior engineer in the area of the development of new products
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057  0.00  9.89 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion it is a good idea that students get a job to pay for their studies
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057  9.89 22.61 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but you have to have a part time job because you have to get a balance between your studies and your job
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 22.61 43.05 <o,Q3,B2,P3> one of the advantages is that you can get experience because a lot of students graduate but they have no idea about what the world of work is like
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 43.05 52.53 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion it is one of the best things that a student can do when they are still studying
SI114J-00057-P40018 1 SI114J-00057  0.00 29.14 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the next picture shows the stages people need to good through when they go to travel by airplane
SI114J-00057-P40018 1 SI114J-00057 29.14 37.16 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all you have to get to the airport and do your check in
SI114J-00057-P40018 1 SI114J-00057 37.16 43.46 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after that you have to go to document control

SI114J-00057-P50019 1 SI114J-00057  8.30 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> one of them is that we can look for all the information using the internet and we can look for example at videos
SI114J-00057-P50020 1 SI114J-00057  0.00 12.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> face to face is the best way to learn because you can see your teacher and you can concentrate better
SI114J-00057-P50020 1 SI114J-00057 12.71 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in this way you do not have distractions
SI114J-00057-P50021 1 SI114J-00057  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> group projects give us the opportunity to learn to work in teams to use all the abilities of each one of the members in a team
SI114J-00057-P50022 1 SI114J-00057  0.00  8.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> watching lectures online by yourself in my opinion it's best because you can pause when you need
SI114J-00057-P50022 1 SI114J-00057  8.89 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> instead when you are attending lectures with other people you cannot do that

SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206  0.00 15.50 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that one advantage is that while you are working you are learning what life is and at the same time you are studying of course
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 15.50 28.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that maybe you are too busy working and studying at the same time so you can get a little stressed
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 28.71 35.86 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and this isn't a good thing for your health
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 35.86 43.56 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that it's a good idea to do both things at the same time working and studying
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 43.56 57.14 <o,Q4,B1,P3> because working you can learn a lot of things that you can't learn studying and studying you can learn things that you can't learn while working

SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233  9.41 19.65 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some of the advantages of having a part time job while studying are that the students take responsibility for their actions
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 19.65 32.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> also they gain the skill of organising their time better and also the skill of working in teams and cooperating with each other
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 32.66 45.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> a disadvantage is that they do not have much time to study so an effect is that their grades decline and they can fall asleep in class
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 45.92 59.87 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my own opinion i think it's a good way for the students to learn teamwork and organisational skills in their life

SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233  6.97 13.66 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first the factors the initial factors are the factories and vehicles

SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 49.27 59.87 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that is why we need to change the factors the vehicles and the factories to reduce acid rain
SI114J-00233-P50019 1 SI114J-00233  0.00 17.87 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all they need to get rid of every candy they have in their house so that they can start eating good food to have a healthy life like fruit and vegetables

SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243  0.00  7.59 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it's a suggestion that all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243  7.59 13.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so there are some obvious advantages to this suggestion
SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 13.20 18.93 <o,Q5,B2,P3> first of all they would get better at financial literacy

SI114J-00243-P30017 1 SI114J-00243 45.13 49.22 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and i think it could be crucial for them

SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243  6.20 15.30 <o,Q5,C,P4> so it basically starts by vehicles and factories releasing emissions into the environment
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 15.30 18.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it all comes out as smoke
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 18.12 32.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and acid particles that are in this smoke are being carried by the wind and are released into the clouds or just fall as dust on the ground
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 32.84 49.69 <o,Q5,C,P4> these particles that are mixed with the cloud they settle on the ground and fall on forests as rain and snow
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 49.69 59.98 <o,Q5,C,P4> and these forests are suffering from acid rain
SI114J-00243-P50019 1 SI114J-00243  0.00 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> i would recommend these people to listen to what their gut feelings tell them because they will know what food they really want and not what their brain but what their body wants to eat

SI114J-00243-P50022 1 SI114J-00243  0.00 17.63 <o,Q5,C,P5> i agree with the opinion that sleeping around eight hours a day is a key habit because if you don't sleep enough you will be tired and won't be productive at all
SI114J-00243-P50023 1 SI114J-00243  0.00 16.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's quite a questionable opinion because technologies truly help people to make their lives easier but not always

SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 10.16 32.94 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that one of the advantages that they have if they are studying and they are working too is that they earn money to spend in their free time
SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 32.94 47.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but maybe the disadvantage is that they don't have enough time to study for example during a week when they have an exam
SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 47.06 59.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion it's very important to work in the field of your studies to gain experience and practise

SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358  8.80 21.76 <o,Q4,B1,P4> the pollution of factories and vehicles goes up with the smoke forming acid particles
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 21.76 28.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then these acid particles that are carried by wind can do two things
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 28.34 34.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> they can be mixed with cloud water or fall as dust
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 34.80 54.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if they mix with cloud water then when the clouds collide they fall with the rain or the snow causing damage to the environment and causing damage to the people that are on the ground
SI114J-00358-P50019 1 SI114J-00358  0.00  7.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it's very important to have good eating habits
SI114J-00358-P50019 1 SI114J-00358  7.26 17.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example you have to have a schedule for what you eat in the evening or in the morning

SI114J-00622-P30017 1 SI114J-00622 23.87 31.41 <o,Q5,C,P3> the one disadvantage i can find is that not all students like to do sports

SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622  0.00  1.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> good afternoon
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622  1.85  8.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> i am going to talk about the process of how honey is produced
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622  8.12 12.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 12.42 18.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> to start we can see in the first circle a bee and flowers
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 18.31 22.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> it represents bees collecting nectar from flowers
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 22.42 28.61 <o,Q5,C,P4> after they collect that nectar the bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 28.61 32.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after that beekeepers collect the honey from the hives
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 32.88 40.39 <o,Q5,C,P4> beekeepers are the people who are in charge of collecting the honey from the beehives
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 40.39 50.38 <o,Q5,C,P4> and also they are in charge of putting the honey into different kinds of jars it could be in a glass bottle or in a plastic bottle
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 50.38 56.97 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after that it can be transported to the supermarket where you are able to acquire it
SI114J-00622-P50019 1 SI114J-00622  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think they have to consider the documentation they need like a passport or visa or other documents the language they speak their customs their traditions their religion and of course the region where it is
SI114J-00622-P50020 1 SI114J-00622  0.00 15.60 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the first advantage you have if you are able to study in a second language is that you will have the opportunity to get a better job and of course make yourself understood in that language

SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644  0.00  4.49 <o,Q4,C,P1> in the future i would love to be a university professor
SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644  4.49 14.68 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would like to teach in the area of education possibly regarding inclusion or didactics
SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644 14.68 20.46 <o,Q4,C,P1> that would be my favorite job my ideal job
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644  0.00 18.99 <o,Q5,C,P3> one advantage of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies would be that once they graduate they would already have some experience and perhaps even some idea of what field they want to go into
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 18.99 22.10 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there are some huge disadvantages
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 22.10 32.19 <o,Q5,C,P3> for instance students might not have enough time to focus on their university studies if they have to be working instead
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 32.19 46.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> drop out rates might increase a lot because what would be the point of studying if you already have a job that is paying quite well certainly well enough to finance a college education
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 46.00 51.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion students should not get jobs to pay for university studies
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 51.87 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> students should get scholarships or some other alternative funding

SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 11.72 15.70 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can do this by different means of transport such as car or bus or even the subway depending on the options available

SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 23.28 28.14 <o,Q4,C,P4> at the check in they will give you some information about your flight

SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 35.74 38.67 <o,Q4,C,P4> you will need your boarding pass as well as your i d to go through document control and security

SI114J-00644-P50020 1 SI114J-00644  0.00 16.21 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think learning with a teacher face to face can be useful for lower levels of learning or young learners people who might have some trouble identifying gaps in their knowledge or managing their own learning

SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  3.62 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm really interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657  3.62  6.42 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example i really love england
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657  6.42 11.83 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have been there several times and i always try to learn something new when i go there
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 11.83 17.31 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example i have read different books i have taken different classes on its culture
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 17.31 19.09 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think it's really interesting
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  2.18 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i do different things
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657  2.18  5.96 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example lately i have taken up cooking
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657  5.96 11.01 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have been developing my cooking skills and i have learnt about different recipes
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 11.01 17.03 <o,Q5,C,P1> but for example i also love listening to music doing sport and of course hanging out with friends
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 17.03 19.60 <o,Q5,C,P1> so that's more or less my free time
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  8.46 <o,Q5,C,P1> well for me the best way of improving your english is being part of a community of people learning english
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657  8.46 12.60 <o,Q5,C,P1> and furthermore also of a community of english speaking people
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657 12.60 18.41 <o,Q5,C,P1> so that way you can be in contact with them and you will learn a lot by communicating with other people
SI114J-00657-P10008 1 SI114J-00657  0.00 17.88 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i would really love to learn how to code because i have always loved technology and computers and i have been so amazed by those programmers who can code a new app or video game just by reading sentences

SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  6.02 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i think that taking a job while you're studying is a really good experience
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657  6.02 14.18 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example some of the advantages will be that you will be able to learn new things which will be useful for your learning experience
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 14.18 24.73 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you will learn how to manage yourself how to develop other skills such as time management and how to organise yourself and how to be responsible for your own actions
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 24.73 27.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there will also be disadvantages
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 27.56 31.74 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you would have less time to focus on your studies
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 31.74 36.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> and so i think it's really important to be able to know what you can do with your time
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 36.82 50.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example if you know that you are going to need a lot of time for studying you shouldn't take a job because it will take you a lot of time and it will not be possible for you to focus on your job or your learning at the university
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 50.53 56.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> so even if it's a really good experience i think that you should be really sure about what you will do
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  5.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> acid rain is generated by vehicles and by factories
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657  5.11 10.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> so when they create pollution that pollution gets up into the atmosphere
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 10.13 18.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> there the acid particles are carried by the wind and end up mixed with particles of water which will create a cloud
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 18.95 23.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> that cloud will end up raining over the earth
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 23.67 25.73 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it will have a lot of effects
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 25.73 33.91 <o,Q5,C,P4> so for example it will cause deforestation it will cause animals to die and it will cause a lot of environmental problems
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 33.91 40.96 <o,Q5,C,P4> for example it could mean that the terrain is not good for growing things
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 40.96 49.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> so we will have not only damage to the environment but also to ourselves because we have to remember that we are living in that environment
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 49.62 55.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> so the effects that we have on it will end up affecting us also
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 55.77 56.97 <o,Q5,C,P4> so yeah
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  5.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> well the best advice on that i can give them is to keep track of what you're eating
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657  5.06 10.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> so for example they can take a piece of paper and write down every day everything they eat
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657 10.86 17.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> so like that at the end of the week they can compare days and they will be able to see ok in which moments they ate unhealthily

SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  2.75 <o,Q5,C,P5> well for me it's really important to drink water
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657  2.75  8.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> we have to remember that we are mainly made up of water so we really should focus on that
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657  8.93 14.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> if we don't take in enough water we could have some effects as severe as depression or anxiety
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657 14.79 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> so by drinking a lot of water we are helping ourselves to be better
SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  5.07 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think that even if it's just for a bit we should do exercise every day

SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657  9.17 15.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> we can also do another type of exercise for example like climbing or walking to work

SI114J-00657-P50022 1 SI114J-00657 13.41 19.77 <o,Q5,C,P5> so i think it's important that we know what we really need and we should try to focus on that

SI114J-00754-P50020 1 SI114J-00754  0.00 11.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the obvious advantage is that a student learns a different language and he understands how to communicate better in that language
SI114J-00754-P50020 1 SI114J-00754 11.36 18.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and besides he or she can learn about a different culture
SI114J-00754-P50021 1 SI114J-00754  0.00  5.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the major drawback will be coping with the culture of the country

SI114J-00754-P50022 1 SI114J-00754  0.00 13.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> while studying abroad students can learn about the local culture by watching movies at a movie theater or by going to a concert with friends

SI1267-00164-P10007 1 SI1267-00164  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B1,P1> the best way to improve my english is to have conversations or speak with my friends because speaking involves the skills of listening and speaking

SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336  0.00  7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think that students doing part time jobs have some advantages
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336  7.41 20.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 20.41 42.15 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some disadvantages of doing that are that they have less time for themselves and it's a really hard life because there isn't enough time
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 42.15 57.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my own opinion i think that this is a good way to start in the business area
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336  0.00  9.77 <o,Q5,B1,P4> okay first industries make pollution and acid particles travel with the smoke
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336  9.77 17.49 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then the acid particles are carried by the wind and some of them fall as dust
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 17.49 38.06 <o,Q5,B1,P4> other particles mix with the clouds and when it rains or snows these fall like acid particles in the environment
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 38.06 51.34 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and this could be very critical for everyone
SI1267-00336-P50020 1 SI1267-00336  0.00 11.80 <o,Q5,B1,P5> drinking water is really important for people because this way you can stay healthy and you can refresh your brain
SI1267-00336-P50020 1 SI1267-00336 11.80 18.92 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and apart from that this makes you function
SI1267-00336-P50021 1 SI1267-00336  0.00  8.50 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah doing exercise every day is really important because this way you can stay stable
SI1267-00336-P50021 1 SI1267-00336  8.50 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and if this is mixed with some good eating habits you will be fit and lose some fat
SI1267-00336-P50022 1 SI1267-00336  0.00 19.26 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yeah sleeping at least eight hours it's good because this way your body can rest during these hours
SI1267-00336-P50023 1 SI1267-00336  0.00 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well actually technology has a positive effect on the life of people because people staying in their house could start doing some exercise
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 11.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm very keen on learning about other cultures because for me it is interesting to see how other people from different parts of the world live and the way they live is very interesting for me
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376 11.50 16.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i can find out more interesting and useful things to learn for example
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376 16.45 18.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's very interesting for me
SI1267-00376-P10006 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  9.68 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my free time i enjoy going for a run in the forest or in the park where i can get fresh air and find interesting animals or plants
SI1267-00376-P10006 1 SI1267-00376  9.68 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i also play tennis with my best friends in the sports hall and another thing i travel a lot in my spare time
SI1267-00376-P10007 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 18.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the best way to improve my english is to go abroad where i can meet a lot of native speakers and they can help me improve my english and at the same time i can get a lot of information about the culture where the language is spoken and the way people live in that country
SI1267-00376-P10008 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  9.95 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i want to improve my skills i will choose communication skills because it's very important nowadays to communicate effectively
SI1267-00376-P10008 1 SI1267-00376  9.95 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> for example if you have a problem you need to explain it properly to people to make them understand your problem
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  8.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> it is very important to do part time jobs while you are studying if you have enough time of course
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376  8.45 19.36 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the advantage of this is that you can get a lot of experience at work and see how it works with working in teams for example
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 19.36 33.69 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you can also achieve goals in many areas such as sharing ideas with others and get feedback from experienced workers
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 33.69 44.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the disadvantage of this is that you have a lot of tasks for university studies and for this you need a lot of time
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 44.04 48.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in this situation part time jobs wouldn't be suitable
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 48.31 55.09 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in my opinion many students should try it because it is very useful
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 17.43 <o,Q5,C,P4> well first of all factories produce products and while they are producing them they also produce dangerous elements which go up into the air and this causes a lot of pollution
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 17.43 21.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then the next step is that acid particles are in smoke
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 21.68 29.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the next stage is acid particles are carried by wind and then the wind carries them in the air to other places
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 29.84 35.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the fourth stage is that some acid particles fall as dust
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 35.85 39.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> the fifth stage is other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 39.14 42.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> the next step is acid particles are in rain or snow
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 42.77 48.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> and other problems with pollution are caused by vehicles
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 48.22 53.24 <o,Q5,C,P4> many forms of transport are used by many factories and other companies
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 53.24 57.65 <o,Q5,C,P4> and so we should reduce the transport
SI1267-00376-P50019 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  8.16 <o,Q5,C,P5> well first of all they should eat more fruit and vegetables as they contain a lot of vitamins which can improve their health
SI1267-00376-P50019 1 SI1267-00376  8.16 17.73 <o,Q5,C,P5> and in the morning people can have cereals for breakfast and they should drink a lot of juice as well
SI1267-00376-P50020 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  8.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's very important to drink lots of water because our body needs it to stay alive and to be more active
SI1267-00376-P50020 1 SI1267-00376  8.27 16.70 <o,Q5,C,P5> for this we need a lot of water and we should drink it as it's life

SI1267-00376-P50021 1 SI1267-00376 10.68 17.73 <o,Q5,C,P5> and everyone needs exercise to be more active and develop physically
SI1267-00376-P50022 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  9.02 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that everyone needs at least eight hours of sleep a day because our brain needs the rest after a busy day

SI1267-00376-P50023 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 14.76 <o,Q4,C,P5> generally speaking in my opinion technology has a positive impact on our life because nowadays we can easily get information from the internet for example and from other resources as well
SI1267-00376-P50023 1 SI1267-00376 14.76 17.90 <o,Q4,C,P5> and we can save our lives
SI1267-00401-P10006 1 SI1267-00401  0.00  6.25 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well actually i enjoy watching t v
SI1267-00401-P10006 1 SI1267-00401  6.25 14.85 <o,Q4,B1,P1> sometimes i go out with my friends to play soccer
SI1267-00401-P10006 1 SI1267-00401 14.85 17.95 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and i play the guitar
SI1267-00401-P10006 1 SI1267-00401 17.95 19.60 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and yeah that's it
SI1267-00401-P10007 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 13.97 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i think with my sister because she is just kinda my age and we've got the same taste
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 17.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think the advantage would be that the students could earn their own money and so they could buy anything that they need
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401 17.86 40.28 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantage could be that they can't study and maybe they get stressed because they are working and studying at the same time
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401 40.28 58.68 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well in my opinion the students should be working and studying at the same time because they can get money
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 10.12 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well first of all you have to get any means of transport for example get on the bus
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 10.12 19.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then that will take you to the airport and you have to check in
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 19.34 42.47 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then it will be document control and the security will maybe stop you to find out about you and something like this
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 42.47 54.16 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you have to wait for a moment and then the plane will board

SI1267-00401-P50019 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think students use the internet because on the internet there is everything and they can research any topic and they can learn about everything
SI1267-00401-P50020 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah i think so because having a teacher with you is the best way to learn any topic because you have a teacher who can help you with any question that you have
SI1267-00401-P50021 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think they could do their homework faster yeah and make friends and get along well
SI1267-00401-P50023 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 17.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very important that universities should have the best learning facilities because university is the highest level school
SI1267-00401-P50023 1 SI1267-00401 17.96 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think so

SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444  0.00 11.11 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i believe that it's important that all the students spend some time in a part time job while they are students
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 11.11 19.36 <o,Q4,B2,P3> because when you are working you learn different things to what you are studying
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 19.36 36.22 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you learn what real life is like and you have the opportunity to be responsible in your work and this is important for your future
SI1267-00444-P30017 1 SI1267-00444 36.22 55.15 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also you can learn about something that is involved in your studies and with this work you can get other knowledge which is different to that you are learning in class

SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444  9.60 20.75 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we can see in this picture we have a lot of factories and vehicles that produce pollution

SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 31.72 44.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these particles fall down to the rainforest as rain or snow and because of this they damage the environment
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 44.60 51.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> also some of these acid particles fall as dust
SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444 51.59 60.72 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and i think it's important to reduce this pollution to avoid problems like that
SI1267-00444-P50019 1 SI1267-00444  0.00 21.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i would tell these people that they should eat more vegetables or fruits than other foods like fast food or something like that because these foods are better than the other ones
SI1267-00444-P50021 1 SI1267-00444  0.00 13.18 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion it's important to do exercise and not only eat good food and drink enough water

SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457  0.00 12.46 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages if students pay the university studies is the students can choose everything
SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457 12.46 22.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> if their parents pay for it students have to follow their educational policy
SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457 22.31 35.73 <o,Q5,B2,P3> next the disadvantage of this idea is if students work very hard they don't have enough time to concentrate on their studies
SI1267-00457-P30017 1 SI1267-00457 35.73 41.02 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it prevents them from doing in depth learning

SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 23.25 30.66 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then they collect the honey in bottles
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 30.66 45.53 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally they carry the bottles by car and display the merchandise
SI1267-00458-P40018 1 SI1267-00458 45.53 52.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so in conclusion i think it is very very delicious honey

SI1267-00508-P10006 1 SI1267-00508  5.51 14.10 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think i spend quite a lot of time watching t v serials like my favourite t v serial is big bang theory
SI1267-00508-P10007 1 SI1267-00508  0.00  8.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think the best way is speaking with my sister and with other people so i can improve my pronunciation
SI1267-00508-P10007 1 SI1267-00508  8.71 17.25 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also watching t v series on the t v to learn new words
SI1267-00508-P10008 1 SI1267-00508  0.00 14.10 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think i would like to learn how to write but write a book or something like that because i think i am the worst at writing
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508  0.00 18.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think students should do part time jobs because some advantages are that you can learn new skills you can have more experience and also you can create new relationships for your work and maybe for your personal life
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 18.12 35.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> and some disadvantages are that maybe like a student you don't have a lot of time and if you have a job and also you need to study it's gonna be difficult and for that you can forget about other relationships like your parents and things like that
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 35.15 49.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i think it's the worst idea to lose those relationships because you're focused only on your job and on studying
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 49.00 54.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think it's the best way to have experience of real work

SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508  7.81 14.25 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we can see in the presentation factories create that pollution and also vehicles
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 14.25 22.32 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they create that pollution that creates acid particles that are in the form of smoke
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 22.32 31.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then those particles are in the air because of the vehicles and factories
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 31.66 36.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that causes acid particles to mix with cloud water
SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 36.16 45.39 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that water as we can see is useful for the trees

SI1267-00518-P50019 1 SI1267-00518 13.25 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you have to involve the team and work with them maybe work more than them

SI1267-00518-P50020 1 SI1267-00518 12.82 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think in a way it's good to manage but it's bad because you have to work more

SI1267-00518-P50022 1 SI1267-00518  9.68 18.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i think it's better to do it face to face because you can see others' ideas more clearly

SI1267-00518-P50023 1 SI1267-00518 10.82 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's really good to have other points of view to share your ideas and maybe you'll be better in other areas
SI1267-00521-P10005 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  4.42 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm very interested in learning about other countries and other cultures
SI1267-00521-P10005 1 SI1267-00521  4.42 11.07 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it's always interesting to know about a culture very different from your own
SI1267-00521-P10006 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  6.64 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy spending my free time watching t v series or playing games or reading a book
SI1267-00521-P10006 1 SI1267-00521  6.64 10.56 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i also like to go to football matches with my friends
SI1267-00521-P10007 1 SI1267-00521  0.00 11.61 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing speaking or watching series or playing games in english or reading a book in english
SI1267-00521-P10007 1 SI1267-00521 11.61 15.17 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so practice is the best way to improve my english in my opinion
SI1267-00521-P10008 1 SI1267-00521  0.00 12.95 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would love to learn to paint so i could paint my own pictures and hang them in my house and maybe even give them to my friends
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  7.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i'm going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of students doing part time jobs while they are studying
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521  7.38 21.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion one advantage will be that working at the same time as studying gives you a sense of responsibility about your life because you have to provide for yourself
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 21.57 36.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand i think that working at the same time that you are studying could affect your academic life negatively because maybe you're too tired after working to start studying properly
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 36.35 38.58 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it will affect your grades
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 38.58 50.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion there are some advantages to working while you're studying but maybe the disadvantages are worse
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  3.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i'm going to give a little talk about acid rain
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521  3.55 12.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain forms firstly when the pollution emitted from factories goes into the air in the form of particles that are in the smoke
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 12.78 15.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then those particles are carried by the wind
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 15.86 22.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some of those particles fall as dust polluting lakes and our forests
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 22.02 28.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the rest of those particles mix with the cloud water and then form clouds
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 28.41 45.37 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when those clouds rain or snow the acid particles go into the soil polluting our trees and our forests and our lakes
SI1267-00521-P50019 1 SI1267-00521  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that the advice i will give to people who want to improve their eating habits will be do not skip any meal and try to replace as much meat as you can with vegetables to try to reduce the meat you eat
SI1267-00521-P50020 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  3.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> oh i think it's very important to drink a lot of water
SI1267-00521-P50020 1 SI1267-00521  3.98  7.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you should try to drink at least two liters of water per day

SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521  6.89  9.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there's no need to do any heavy exercise
SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521  9.59 14.85 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you could also just go for a walk or try some light exercise

SI1267-00521-P50022 1 SI1267-00521  4.79 14.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> problem is that you can't always get them because you maybe have to get up early in the morning to go to work or study
SI1267-00521-P50022 1 SI1267-00521 14.33 19.09 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's always complicated but definitely you should try to sleep at least eight hours

SI1267-00712-P30017 1 SI1267-00712  9.52 24.37 <o,Q5,C,P3> students firstly would have their own income and that would allow them some financial independence from their parents as well as becoming more responsible in their money management
SI1267-00712-P30017 1 SI1267-00712 24.37 39.72 <o,Q5,C,P3> the disadvantage though is if they need to work while attending classes as they would have to manage their time between their work duties and their university responsibilities

SI1267-00712-P50019 1 SI1267-00712  0.00  5.51 <o,Q5,C,P5> the first advice on eating is start to include your five a day in your diet
SI1267-00712-P50019 1 SI1267-00712  5.51 14.20 <o,Q5,C,P5> and another very important step is to cut out junk food and sugary foods from your meals

SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753  5.45 17.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example they may consider whether they like the food in those countries whether the weather is great and so on
SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753 17.44 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there is a lot to consider
SI1267-00753-P50021 1 SI1267-00753  0.00 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think foreign students may find it difficult to make friends or fit in with local students because they grew up in two different cultures and the cultural difference can prevent them from being together
SI1267-00753-P50022 1 SI1267-00753  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think foreign students can ask local students to share something about their unique culture because those local students have lived in that country for many years and they definitely have a deeper understanding of their culture
SI1267-00753-P50023 1 SI1267-00753  0.00 13.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well studying abroad can definitely help a student become independent because in a foreign country there are no relatives and you need to solve all the problems on your own
SI1267-00753-P50023 1 SI1267-00753 13.82 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's really challenging but it can also benefit you a lot
SI1267-00797-P10006 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  6.89 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i am on holiday i enjoy relaxing of course
SI1267-00797-P10006 1 SI1267-00797  6.89 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy swimming at the beach or at the swimming pool for example or going out and visiting the city where i am staying
SI1267-00797-P10007 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  9.43 <o,Q5,B1,P1> normally i enjoy spending time with my brother because we have similar interests
SI1267-00797-P10007 1 SI1267-00797  9.43 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so every day we play video games together
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  6.49 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would like to get a job as an occupational therapist
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797  6.49  9.63 <o,Q5,B1,P1> actually i am studying for that
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797  9.63 14.83 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but i would like to get a job as a physiotherapist too
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797 14.83 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's one of my dreams so i would like to do that
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797  0.00 17.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion it's reasonable that students get jobs to pay for their university studies because actually university studies are very expensive
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 17.53 30.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> the advantage is that you will earn money easily because you are working
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 30.48 44.11 <o,Q5,C,P3> the disadvantage is that you haven't got a lot of time to prepare your subjects in the university
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 44.11 49.36 <o,Q5,C,P3> so you have less time than others
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 49.36 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion it's reasonable because university studies are very expensive but it's very hard to do this
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  8.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> firstly you need to travel to the airport and go to do the check in

SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 28.46 36.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you are waiting you can have something to drink or eat or go to the toilets
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 36.79 52.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and when they call you to board the plane you will take off and go where you want to go
SI1267-00797-P50020 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  8.99 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's a good option for understanding all the doubts that you have
SI1267-00797-P50020 1 SI1267-00797  8.99 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if you don't understand something in relation to the unit that you are studying a teacher could help you
SI1267-00797-P50022 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  8.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that attending lectures is a good option for understanding things that you don't know
SI1267-00797-P50022 1 SI1267-00797  8.54 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if you don't understand what the teacher has said attending a lecture will help you with that
SI1267-00797-P50023 1 SI1267-00797  0.00 19.60 <o,Q5,B2,P5> universities want to improve these modern learning facilities because thanks to them the students can understand all the information more easily
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  4.49 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my favourite time of the year is absolutely christmas
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809  4.49 10.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really love the atmosphere but also the cold
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 10.52 15.04 <o,Q5,B2,P1> the weather like snow also rain
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 15.04 16.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i really like rain
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809 16.52 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i think it's the best time of the year
SI1267-00809-P10006 1 SI1267-00809  0.00 10.82 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it's really important to read the news like the local ones newspapers but also on the web on the internet

SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  8.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> i completely agree with the idea that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809  8.41 32.10 <o,Q4,C,P3> indeed i think that the main advantage of including a period of practical work experience is the fact that probably after this practical work experience students can find a job and they also improve their practical abilities
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 32.10 49.24 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think well the main disadvantage of this idea is the fact that probably people will think that it's like a waste of time because they can't study while they are working
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 49.24 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> well in my opinion i would like to include a period of practical work during my studies
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809  0.00 13.39 <o,Q5,C,P4> this graph shows the number of people visiting these three different sites tunes net music now songs for you during their first week online
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809 13.39 32.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> we can see that on the vertical axis there are the numbers of thousands of people and the days of the week are shown on the horizontal one
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809 32.31 57.48 <o,Q5,C,P4> we can see that from the fifth day to the seventh day tunes net had an increase and there is a drop for songs for you and a slight drop for music now
SI1267-00809-P50019 1 SI1267-00809  0.00 14.36 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the main characteristics of a team leader are ambition also cooperativeness and enthusiasm
SI1267-00809-P50019 1 SI1267-00809 14.36 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that these three are the most important characteristics of team leaders
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  4.15 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think there is only one problem with a small team
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809  4.15 17.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> well the fact that if a group is small probably there are few ideas
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809 17.30 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and this is a disadvantage
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  3.96 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the most important thing is collaboration
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809  3.96 13.58 <o,Q4,C,P5> obviously members can't always agree with the ideas of other members
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809 13.58 18.87 <o,Q4,C,P5> but it's important to come to a resolution

SI1267-00809-P50022 1 SI1267-00809  0.00 13.27 <o,Q4,C,P5> yeah i think that it's very important to create a face to face team rather than an online group
SI1267-00809-P50022 1 SI1267-00809 13.27 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that a face to face team could create more collaboration
SI1267-00809-P50023 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  2.73 <o,Q5,C,P5> i completely agree with this sentence
SI1267-00809-P50023 1 SI1267-00809  2.73 17.84 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that the best results for a group are possible only if they collaborate and they are open minded and they accept others' ideas

SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 10.36 15.02 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the bees make honey from the nectar in beehives

SI1267-00810-P40018 1 SI1267-00810 20.52 28.29 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the beekeepers make the honey and they put the honey into a jar

SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 16.07 26.13 <o,Q4,C,P3> so apart from paying the university they also buy everything they want
SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 26.13 33.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> but one disadvantage is they maybe spend more time in their job than on their studies
SI1267-00826-P30017 1 SI1267-00826 33.95 51.38 <o,Q4,C,P3> so in my opinion if they have the time to work to get a job to invest time in their job they can do it

SI1267-00862-P40018 1 SI1267-00862 48.83 58.68 <o,Q4,C,P4> and when they tell you to you should board the plane and get ready because the airplane will take off soon

SI1267-01003-P40018 1 SI1267-01003  6.13 12.63 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first step in creating acid rain is pollution
SI1267-01003-P40018 1 SI1267-01003 12.63 17.18 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then acid particles are in smoke

SI1267-01003-P50019 1 SI1267-01003  0.00 18.75 <o,Q5,B2,P5> a recommendation that i can give the person is that if he or she wants she can go or he can go to a nutritionist to get tips on his or her eating habits
SI1267-01003-P50020 1 SI1267-01003  0.00 16.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well in my opinion it is very important because our body is made up of seventeen percent water so that is why all doctors recommend us to drink almost two liters of water a day
SI1267-01003-P50021 1 SI1267-01003  0.00 15.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well some recommendations from my point of view doing exercises every day it's an option but you can also do them twice or three times a week
SI1267-01003-P50022 1 SI1267-01003  0.00  9.32 <o,Q5,B2,P5> sleep time is very important because that is when we recharge our batteries or our energies
SI1267-01003-P50022 1 SI1267-01003  9.32 15.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is highly recommended by doctors to sleep almost eight hours

SI1267-01027-P10008 1 SI1267-01027 11.31 15.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's a lot of math and it's just really hard
SI1267-01027-P10008 1 SI1267-01027 15.73 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i'm still thinking about it
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027  0.00 13.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if there are many jobs that are available this is a really great opportunity for all students to get jobs to pay for their university studies
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 13.29 20.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but some students do also have parents who pay for their university studies which is not as good
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 20.88 33.43 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage is as i mentioned before if you are working while you're studying at the same time it can affect your grades in a bad way
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 33.43 46.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion it's good to get a job to pay for your university studies so that you don't have to borrow money from your parents or the bank
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 46.80 58.68 <o,Q4,B2,P3> yeah it's not good to borrow money but it's not good either if you're failing your tests
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027  0.00  7.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so before you travel by airplane of course you have to travel to the airport first
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027  7.55 11.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so you can choose between going by car bus or train
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 11.30 25.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i recommend taking a bus or train because if you're driving a car to the airport you have to pay for the parking so obviously it's not worth it if you're paying for a ticket
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 25.77 35.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and you will go through document control and security with your baggage
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 35.30 44.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you can just wait at the airport perhaps go to the toilet eat some food and buy some gifts
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 44.20 48.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when your plane has arrived it's time to board
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 48.33 58.68 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you just wait for your airplane to start flying up in the sky
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027  0.00  4.38 <o,Q4,C,P5> you can go to websites to get feedback
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027  4.38 12.40 <o,Q4,C,P5> you can write using computers which is much easier than writing on paper
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027 12.40 19.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> but i recommend writing on paper because you will remember the text a lot better

SI1267-01027-P50022 1 SI1267-01027 17.06 19.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> so if you have the chance do it
SI1267-01027-P50023 1 SI1267-01027  0.00 19.43 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it's really important for the students to have a great modern learning facility for them to concentrate and a facility that works for everyone and that will be silent modern technology for everyone to use

SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062  5.71  9.09 <o,Q4,C,P4> to get to the airport is not very difficult
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062  9.09 10.92 <o,Q4,C,P4> quite the opposite it's simple
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 10.92 15.57 <o,Q4,C,P4> you need to get there by bus by car or by train
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 15.57 22.51 <o,Q4,C,P4> once you are there you have to do the check in and leave your big suitcase
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 22.51 29.53 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you will pass document control where you have to be ready with your i d and your passport
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 29.53 37.50 <o,Q4,C,P4> if everything is ok you will go to the security where a guard will check your belongings
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 37.50 41.19 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then all you have do is wait
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 41.19 46.95 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can have a coffee you can go shopping you can go to the bathroom have some food
SI1267-01062-P40018 1 SI1267-01062 46.95 51.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then thirty minutes before departure you will go to your gate

SI1267-01062-P50019 1 SI1267-01062  0.00 10.19 <o,Q3,B2,P5> i reckon google is a really good app to search for different information and to learn new things but just if you know how to use it
SI1267-01062-P50019 1 SI1267-01062 10.19 14.65 <o,Q3,B2,P5> so i suggest searching on different websites
SI1267-01062-P50020 1 SI1267-01062  0.00 11.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i reckon face to face is much better because based on my opinion and i am studying a master's online it's so difficult when you have doubts
SI1267-01062-P50020 1 SI1267-01062 11.07 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i have to write an email and wait one day until someone replies to my email

SI1267-01078-P30017 1 SI1267-01078 10.97 17.11 <o,Q3,B2,P3> those are usually heavily outweighed by the benefits that it brings

SI1267-01188-P30017 1 SI1267-01188 22.47 39.86 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and talking about on the other hand the disadvantages i think that at that age they should focus on studying and just be focused on what they want to be and to become what they want to be in the future
SI1267-01188-P30017 1 SI1267-01188 39.86 59.98 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion i don't think that students should get jobs in order to pay for university because it should be free in my view or cost less so everyone would be capable of getting into university

SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 14.24 20.34 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i recommend you travel an hour and a half or two hours before you have to fly
SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 20.34 33.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> secondly it is very important to do the check in once you get to the airport before you pass several controls such as document control or security control

SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 55.12 59.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so i would say those are the main steps
SI1267-01188-P50019 1 SI1267-01188  0.00 17.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think students can use technology to access other platforms or other options rather than books to study and be connected with people to share knowledge and notes
SI1267-01188-P50019 1 SI1267-01188 17.17 19.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think that's very helpful
SI1267-01188-P50020 1 SI1267-01188  0.00  7.59 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think obviously learning face to face with a professor or teacher is a better option
SI1267-01188-P50020 1 SI1267-01188  7.59 12.38 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you get a different perspective

SI1267-01188-P50021 1 SI1267-01188  0.00 12.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think the most important skill that a student can learn from group projects is to hear people listen to people and learn from them
SI1267-01188-P50021 1 SI1267-01188 12.89 19.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> obviously other ones are sharing thoughts and respecting your teammates

SI1267-01188-P50022 1 SI1267-01188  3.52 12.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you listen to a professional like your teacher and you have the option of listening to the doubts of other students

SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 25.29 36.26 <o,Q5,B2,P4> some of these acid particles fall to the soil as dust but other acid particles are mixed with the water in the clouds
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 36.26 44.89 <o,Q5,B2,P4> as a result these acid particles fall to the earth in rain or snow
SI127E-00250-P40018 1 SI127E-00250 44.89 54.84 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this acid rain damages the environment including the soil air water animals humans and trees

SI127E-00510-P10005 1 SI127E-00510  0.00  9.53 <o,Q4,C,P1> i am quite interested in it because it's allowed me to enrich my knowledge about other people around the world
SI127E-00510-P10005 1 SI127E-00510  9.53 14.68 <o,Q4,C,P1> and it can make me more sage in the future
SI127E-00510-P10005 1 SI127E-00510 14.68 19.86 <o,Q4,C,P1> and it gives me an open mind
SI127E-00510-P10006 1 SI127E-00510  0.00  8.79 <o,Q4,C,P1> generally speaking i like going around with my friends going for a walk and so on
SI127E-00510-P10006 1 SI127E-00510  8.79 18.37 <o,Q4,C,P1> and i also like to drink some beer or coffee while we are talking about our daily life or daily problems
SI127E-00510-P10006 1 SI127E-00510 18.37 19.67 <o,Q4,C,P1> well it's useful
SI127E-00510-P10007 1 SI127E-00510  0.00  6.92 <o,Q4,C,P1> well the best way to improve your english is practicing a lot
SI127E-00510-P10007 1 SI127E-00510  6.92 20.04 <o,Q4,C,P1> and especially when you have the chance to speak a lot with other people so that you can check if you are understood you know and that's quite important
SI127E-00510-P10008 1 SI127E-00510  0.00  6.29 <o,Q4,C,P1> i've always wanted to know how to cook because it is very important
SI127E-00510-P10008 1 SI127E-00510  6.29 15.27 <o,Q4,C,P1> it's essential in life having notions about how to prepare your own meals
SI127E-00510-P10008 1 SI127E-00510 15.27 20.04 <o,Q4,C,P1> so for me it would be vital for my life
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510  0.00 20.91 <o,Q5,C,P3> well it's a good thing that students do a part time job while they are a student because the benefit is that they can save money for their expenses such as food clothes travel the tickets for commuting and so on

SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 37.15 45.28 <o,Q5,C,P3> but in conclusion from my point of view it's a perfect way to start to be financially independent from your parents
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 45.28 55.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> also you have the chance to organise your time to combine work and studying
SI127E-00510-P30017 1 SI127E-00510 55.30 59.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> so it's a good way to become independent and mature
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510  0.00  7.15 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it is obvious that we must end the pollution in our cities
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510  7.15 14.95 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this is because they are producing acid rain
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 14.95 26.89 <o,Q5,B2,P4> this is caused by the acid particles in smoke which is carried by the wind
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 26.89 38.44 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and some acid particles fall as dust and others mix with the clouds' water
SI127E-00510-P40018 1 SI127E-00510 38.44 55.67 <o,Q5,B2,P4> that provokes those acid particles to fall down to the ground and that affects the growth of the plants and that affects the human population as well

SI127E-00510-P50019 1 SI127E-00510  0.00 17.38 <o,Q5,C,P5> well one of the pieces of advice would be to start eating fruits and vegetables as much as possible and avoid having products with a high amount of sugar
SI127E-00510-P50019 1 SI127E-00510 17.38 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> that is the main point
SI127E-00510-P50021 1 SI127E-00510  0.00  8.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> yes at least thirty minutes of walking can help you have a better life

SI127E-00510-P50022 1 SI127E-00510  2.42  7.67 <o,Q5,C,P5> almost as much as you need
SI127E-00510-P50022 1 SI127E-00510  7.67 17.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> because it's a time when the body recovers from any illnesses or damage that it has had during the day
SI127E-00510-P50022 1 SI127E-00510 17.94 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> so it's quite important
SI127E-00510-P50023 1 SI127E-00510  0.00 18.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> depends on the device because if you have a heart attack there are devices that detect that problem easily so medical devices have improved a lot
SI127E-00510-P50023 1 SI127E-00510 18.47 20.04 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it's very important too

SI127E-00561-P10006 1 SI127E-00561  0.00 16.30 <o,Q5,C,P1> we enjoy doing different things together but one of the things that we probably do most is to go out for a beer and not a couple of beers just to have yeah interesting or normal conversation about some serious thing

SI127E-00561-P30017 1 SI127E-00561 16.98 32.47 <o,Q5,C,P3> about the disadvantages i'd say one of the main disadvantages would be that they probably would have less time to work on other subjects so we have to take that into consideration
SI127E-00561-P30017 1 SI127E-00561 32.47 47.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> my opinion i think from my point of view i'd say that we should all schools should schedule some fitness lessons some fitness classes periodically

SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 13.44 21.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> i think the first stage is that the bees collect nectar from flowers and then they will make honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-00561-P40018 1 SI127E-00561 21.22 27.78 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that the men who are beekeepers collect honey from the beehives

SI127E-00561-P50020 1 SI127E-00561  0.00  5.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> when you study in a second language the main thing the main advantage is that you are going to learn the other language

SI127E-00611-P10005 1 SI127E-00611  5.32 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so we have to take great care of this because in the future our children are going to live on the earth and we have to keep it as best we can together
SI127E-00611-P10006 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i met most of my friends in the travel agency where i used to work so the thing that we really enjoy the most is travelling all together especially to mexico because we love the beaches over there and all the food and the traditions
SI127E-00611-P10007 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 10.52 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say that i'm very close to my mum because she's the one who spends the most time with me and we are also creating a business together
SI127E-00611-P10007 1 SI127E-00611 10.52 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so we do really enjoy doing the same things like for example developing this hand made jewellery brand
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  7.59 <o,Q4,B2,P1> two years ago i had the opportunity to study abroad in the u s and there i discovered miami
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611  7.59 16.09 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would say that miami it's my kind of place where there's always good weather and many things to do
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611 16.09 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so definitely i would love to live there in the future
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 21.64 <o,Q4,B2,P3> when talking about introducing fitness classes in schools i would say that there are more advantages than disadvantages to it because it is undeniable that getting students to do exercises at least thirty minutes a day it helps them to be in better shape and to be healthier in the future
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 21.64 27.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i would say that these are the main advantages
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 27.57 41.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantage it's that it will take a lot of time for the students to get ready for it and then shower after doing those fitness classes

SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  8.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so today we are going to go through the whole process of how honey goes from a flower to the shop
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611  8.29 15.45 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so firstly the bees collect the nectar from the flowers especially during the spring
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 15.45 22.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they make honey from the nectar in their beehives which are their homes
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 22.82 43.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so once the beekeepers who are watching those beehives see that there's a bunch of honey they collect it and they send it to the manufacturing companies who actually put it into individual jars
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 43.20 57.31 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that those companies are the ones that transport it and sell it to the stores where we are able to get it when we go to the supermarkets
SI127E-00611-P50019 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> based on my personal experience a candidate that is trying to choose a country to study in the first thing that they have to take into account is the language because otherwise it is going to be very difficult for them to follow all the classes and to be integrated in the classroom
SI127E-00611-P50020 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.77 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the benefits of studying in a second language they are very clear because you get to know more people and you are able to travel by yourself to more countries where you are going to have more possibilities to express yourself to other people
SI127E-00611-P50021 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  5.02 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that there are many barriers that you could face when studying in another country
SI127E-00611-P50021 1 SI127E-00611  5.02 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> for instance not only the language itself because you can learn that but the traditions and the culture there at the very beginning can be very shocking for a foreign student
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  8.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> when you are abroad you have to really learn about the local culture by hanging out with locals
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611  8.46 16.39 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you just keep hanging out with the international people you are not going to be immersed in it
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611 16.39 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it is not going to be as beneficial as possible
SI127E-00611-P50023 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> personally i totally agree with that statement because for many people when you study abroad it is your first time being independent without your parents and you learn how to actually manage all your finances your house and everything doing the groceries and everything
SI127E-00723-P10005 1 SI127E-00723  0.00 10.20 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm from cadiz but i live in granada because i'm studying there

SI127E-00723-P30017 1 SI127E-00723 24.31 31.54 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it's more difficult to work and study
SI127E-00723-P30017 1 SI127E-00723 31.54 55.71 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my opinion all students should work and study at the same time in the last year of their degree

SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774  9.74 14.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> you can use a car bus a train or a taxi
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 14.88 18.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> once you're there you have to go to the terminal
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 18.77 23.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after that you have to go to the check in
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 23.62 28.28 <o,Q5,C,P4> they will check your luggage
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 28.28 36.16 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that you have to show your i d identification
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 36.16 38.48 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after that you go to security
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 38.48 42.16 <o,Q5,C,P4> they will check that your bag is safe
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 42.16 49.89 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then when you pass the security you will have to wait until it's time to board the plane
SI127E-00774-P40018 1 SI127E-00774 49.89 56.63 <o,Q5,C,P4> and when you board the plane then you can go
SI127E-00774-P50019 1 SI127E-00774  0.00  4.83 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we can use technology in some different ways
SI127E-00774-P50019 1 SI127E-00774  4.83 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P5> with computers and tablets we have a lot of information and we can use the internet to do all the work in all the studies that we need
SI127E-00774-P50020 1 SI127E-00774  0.00 16.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion i prefer to attend a face to face class because i think i can focus more on what the teacher is saying and i can take better notes
SI127E-00774-P50021 1 SI127E-00774  0.00  8.93 <o,Q5,B2,P5> working on group projects is a good way to work because it has a lot of benefits for everyone in the group
SI127E-00774-P50021 1 SI127E-00774  8.93 12.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we learn to split the task
SI127E-00774-P50021 1 SI127E-00774 12.11 18.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we learn to work together and cooperate
SI127E-00774-P50021 1 SI127E-00774 18.36 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i think it's very useful
SI127E-00774-P50022 1 SI127E-00774  0.00 13.96 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think that attending lectures is worse than reading on your own because you are not as focused as when you are reading
SI127E-00774-P50022 1 SI127E-00774 13.96 19.26 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and that's why i think it's better to read on your own
SI127E-00774-P50023 1 SI127E-00774  0.00  7.26 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for universities learning facilities are a basic thing
SI127E-00774-P50023 1 SI127E-00774  7.26 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> they have to provide good learning facilities for the students so they can do their degrees effectively
SI127E-00781-P10006 1 SI127E-00781  0.00  7.12 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like playing the trumpet with my father or with the band on friday

SI127E-00781-P10007 1 SI127E-00781  0.00 11.44 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way is to go abroad to england for example but it's very difficult for me because i don't have enough money
SI127E-00781-P10007 1 SI127E-00781 11.44 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think the best option is to study in an english academy

SI127E-00781-P10008 1 SI127E-00781 14.77 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i think i could work on that
SI127E-00781-P30017 1 SI127E-00781  0.00  7.68 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the one hand you can earn money if you work

SI127E-00781-P30017 1 SI127E-00781  8.38 22.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and you can help your parents because they are the ones who pay for all your studies

SI127E-00781-P30017 1 SI127E-00781 23.34 30.23 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand it's very difficult studying and working at the same time
SI127E-00781-P30017 1 SI127E-00781 30.23 37.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> this interferes with your studies
SI127E-00781-P30017 1 SI127E-00781 37.30 43.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's difficult to pass with a high mark in all cases

SI127E-00781-P50019 1 SI127E-00781  0.00 19.04 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i recommend other people to eat healthy food for example vegetables salad because fast food is bad for us

SI127E-00900-P10006 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 11.39 <o,Q4,B2,P1> when i'm on holiday i enjoy haging out with friends also spending time with my family who are not near to me during the whole year
SI127E-00900-P10006 1 SI127E-00900 11.39 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i also like to travel to and discover new places that i don't know
SI127E-00900-P10007 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really enjoy spending time with my sister because she doesn't live with me and i really like being with her and spending quality time with her because she's a very important person in my life and i really love to have time with her
SI127E-00900-P10008 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would like to be a hotel manager but i don't know if it is going to be possible but i am going to work in a tourist company because this is what i studied and it is the thing that i want to work in
SI127E-00900-P30017 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 22.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion students have to work to pay for their university studies if their families don't have enough resources to meet that cost but i think if they have the support the financial support of their families they should not work
SI127E-00900-P30017 1 SI127E-00900 22.08 59.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> because i think that the advantage of working to pay for your studies is that you have financial independence and you don't have to depend on your parents but it is going to take you a lot of time when you must be studying or a lot of rest time which you need to have energy and to improve and to have good results in your studies in your university studies
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900  0.00  7.83 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so this graph shows us the different steps that you have to follow to travel by airplane
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900  7.83 11.93 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we can see the first step is that you have to travel to the airport
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 11.93 14.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can do it by car by train or by bus
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 14.77 21.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to do the check in with your travel company
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 21.16 26.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this is the first step
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 26.05 41.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the next step is that you have to pass the document control with the police and then you have to pass the security control where they are going to check your luggage
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 41.14 44.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to wait before the boarding time
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 44.34 53.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the airport you have many things to do like shopping have a coffee have lunch
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 53.54 58.68 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you can board the plane
SI127E-00900-P50019 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 15.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that the students search on the internet for many different articles that can help them to improve their learning

SI127E-00900-P50020 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that learning face to face with a teacher is the best way to learn because you have the person in front of you to ask her or him all the questions that you have and they can help you with your issues
SI127E-00900-P50022 1 SI127E-00900  0.00  8.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me it works better to read alone because i prefer to be by myself with my thoughts
SI127E-00900-P50022 1 SI127E-00900  8.70 17.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i prefer this way of reading to attending a series of lectures where they can distract you
SI127E-00900-P50022 1 SI127E-00900 17.14 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't know for me it's better to read alone

SI127E-00900-P50023 1 SI127E-00900 17.41 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and i think that is very helpful
SI127E-00904-P10005 1 SI127E-00904  0.00 13.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the place where i live is quiet and there's not a lot of people so you can sleep well here
SI127E-00904-P10005 1 SI127E-00904 13.73 15.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> there is a lot of nature
SI127E-00904-P10005 1 SI127E-00904 15.50 17.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's a village it's not a city
SI127E-00904-P10005 1 SI127E-00904 17.63 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so that's it
SI127E-00904-P10006 1 SI127E-00904  0.00  8.12 <o,Q5,B2,P1> when i'm on holiday i love to go to the swimming pool and swim and be with my friends there

SI127E-00904-P30017 1 SI127E-00904  0.00 19.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if students worked to pay their studies they would be more independent from their parents and also they would be more prepared for real life because things have to be paid off
SI127E-00904-P30017 1 SI127E-00904 19.80 35.97 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantages i would say the time for studying is less so they might have worse marks in their degree
SI127E-00904-P30017 1 SI127E-00904 35.97 54.20 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so my opinion is that parents should support their children to pay for their studies because everyone not everyone but the majority of people want to study and have a future you know
SI127E-00904-P30017 1 SI127E-00904 54.20 59.36 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i would say no

SI127E-01118-P30017 1 SI127E-01118  3.36  4.65 <o,Q4,B1,P3> okay
SI127E-01118-P30017 1 SI127E-01118  4.65 17.91 <o,Q4,B1,P3> one of the advantages of this is that the students could study at university
SI127E-01118-P30017 1 SI127E-01118 17.91 34.13 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and another advantage is that yes if the students study at university they will get a good job in the future
SI127E-01118-P30017 1 SI127E-01118 34.13 41.77 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well one of the disadvantages is the students will have less time to study
SI127E-01118-P30017 1 SI127E-01118 41.77 52.78 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and they maybe won't be able to hang out with their friends
SI127E-01118-P30017 1 SI127E-01118 52.78 59.87 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion university might be cheaper
SI127E-01118-P40018 1 SI127E-01118  0.00  8.18 <o,Q4,B2,P4> well first obviously you must go to the airport
SI127E-01118-P40018 1 SI127E-01118  8.18 14.40 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can go by bus by train or in your car
SI127E-01118-P40018 1 SI127E-01118 14.40 27.52 <o,Q4,B2,P4> ok when you arrive at the airport you must go to the check in and the security control
SI127E-01118-P40018 1 SI127E-01118 27.52 38.31 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that you must wait around two hours more or less for the plane
SI127E-01118-P40018 1 SI127E-01118 38.31 52.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and you can wait in the restaurant and you can go to the w c or cafe or shopping
SI127E-01118-P40018 1 SI127E-01118 52.34 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you board the plane and finally you relax and travel
SI127E-01118-P50019 1 SI127E-01118  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> students can maybe use the technology to study because there are some websites with a lot of information about different topics and students might find these interesting
SI127E-01118-P50020 1 SI127E-01118  0.00 10.08 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion learning face to face with a teacher is a good way to learn

SI127E-01118-P50022 1 SI127E-01118  2.21 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> reading alone is so good for learning about a topic but attending lectures is another good way to learn about it
SI127E-01118-P50023 1 SI127E-01118  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's very important that the university gives to the students facilities like internet books dictionaries et cetera
SI127E-01144-P10005 1 SI127E-01144  0.00 14.74 <o,Q5,A2,P1> i'm interested in ensuring my environment is clean and the temperature is comfortable and that's all

SI127E-01144-P30017 1 SI127E-01144  0.00 29.00 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so the advantage is that all students' health improves because they are in this society and a lot of students don't move their body
SI127E-01144-P30017 1 SI127E-01144 29.00 47.44 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but the disadvantage is if they have a handicap and they can't join the classes so they have bad things bad fears
SI127E-01144-P30017 1 SI127E-01144 47.44 58.59 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so my opinion is the college should have the fitness classes because their health will improve
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144  0.00  8.56 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so i will explain how to make honey

SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 16.59 23.20 <o,Q5,B1,P4> the first one bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 23.20 30.23 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the second step bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 30.23 38.48 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the next step beekeepers collect honey from beehives
SI127E-01144-P40018 1 SI127E-01144 38.48 47.84 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the honey is moved to the shop and sold
SI127E-01144-P50020 1 SI127E-01144  0.00 12.91 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so the advantage of studying in a second language is they can talk to a lot of people in other countries

SI127E-01271-P10007 1 SI127E-01271 12.70 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so yeah i look similar to her
SI127E-01271-P10008 1 SI127E-01271  0.00  4.01 <o,Q5,B2,P1> well i like many countries including spain
SI127E-01271-P10008 1 SI127E-01271  4.01 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but i think if i had to choose one i would go to italy because it's a country that i have always thought like it's the best country
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271  0.00  2.93 <o,Q5,B2,P3> well there are many advantages
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271  2.93  8.76 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example they can relax if they are very stressed because of their studies
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271  8.76 25.49 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i don't think that it has disadvantages but well if i have to say one i will say that students can become obsessed with sport
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271 25.49 39.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> we know that when they are teenagers they don't feel so comfortable with their bodies so it could be dangerous if they become obsessed
SI127E-01271-P30017 1 SI127E-01271 39.72 51.00 <o,Q5,B2,P3> in my opinion sport is an essential activity for staying healthy so young people should practice it very often
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271  0.00  7.25 <o,Q5,B2,P4> we usually buy honey in shops but have you ever thought how it is produced
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271  7.25 13.40 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 13.40 17.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and with this nectar bees make honey in their beehives
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 17.80 22.18 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then the beekeepers take the honey from the beehives
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 22.18 29.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the next step is to put the honey in a container so it can be distributed in shops
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 29.82 35.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally the honey is in stores so people can buy it
SI127E-01271-P50019 1 SI127E-01271  0.00 10.69 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think that i won't have any doubts choosing a country it will be italy
SI127E-01271-P50019 1 SI127E-01271 10.69 16.07 <o,Q4,B1,P5> since i was little i have always wanted to go there

SI127E-01271-P50020 1 SI127E-01271  0.00  5.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that it helps us to travel around the world
SI127E-01271-P50020 1 SI127E-01271  5.94 11.45 <o,Q5,B1,P5> we can communicate with other people
SI127E-01271-P50020 1 SI127E-01271 11.45 19.60 <o,Q5,B1,P5> also we can find a job more quickly if we know how to speak another language

SI127E-01294-P10006 1 SI127E-01294 14.05 17.70 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i play a video game just like once a year

SI127E-01294-P10007 1 SI127E-01294  0.00  7.44 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i said this in a previous question it's going to be my little brother
SI127E-01294-P10007 1 SI127E-01294  7.44 17.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> this is because i play a video game with him and you know we play the same sport baseball so we play catch together

SI127E-01294-P10008 1 SI127E-01294  6.24 11.79 <o,Q5,B2,P1> this is because it was just my childhood dream since i was very little
SI127E-01294-P10008 1 SI127E-01294 11.79 17.52 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also this is sometimes my current dream too
SI127E-01294-P10008 1 SI127E-01294 17.52 21.16 <o,Q5,B2,P1> so i think that's what i want to be
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294  0.00 13.08 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think that there are lots of pros and cons to getting a job to pay for your university studies
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 13.08 38.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> one of the advantages is that you can get work experience to explore what you are interested in and also try to figure out what you need in the future like specific skills and anything that you can learn
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 38.30 45.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> but the disadvantage will be that your focus will be on the job not your studies
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 45.48 50.70 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in my opinion you should do a part time job
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 50.70 55.70 <o,Q5,C,P3> however you should mainly focus on your studies at university
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 55.70 61.46 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in that way you can explore your interests
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294  0.00 11.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> so nowadays a lot of people travel a lot so i will give a presentation about how to travel by airplane
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 11.09 19.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> we have three steps after you get to the airport until you board the airplane
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 19.95 24.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> so once you get to the airport you have to check in
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 24.67 35.26 <o,Q5,C,P4> yeah you have to check in your luggage and also give the clerk your identification and ticket

SI127E-01294-P50019 1 SI127E-01294 11.30 21.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think if you've got an ipad or something like that you can take notes on that and also you can see the textbook on that
SI127E-01294-P50020 1 SI127E-01294  0.00 21.34 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i think learning like face to face is great but this is because i can show the teacher the part that i don't get and the teacher can focus on just teaching that to me

SI127E-01318-P30017 1 SI127E-01318 17.72 24.49 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the main disadvantage in my opinion it's the students' tiredness

SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383  9.40 16.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> also students can gain work experience and they will be more qualified when they finish college
SI127E-01383-P30017 1 SI127E-01383 16.91 22.00 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are that they won't have much time left to study

SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 15.61 18.71 <o,Q5,C,P4> for example you can go by car by bus or by train
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 18.71 27.65 <o,Q5,C,P4> then after you arrive there you'll need to do the check in where your documents will be controlled

SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 36.64 46.08 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you will be free to wait in an area where you can buy presents eat something or you can go to the bathroom

SI127E-01383-P50019 1 SI127E-01383  0.00  2.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but it has a lot of advantages
SI127E-01383-P50019 1 SI127E-01383  2.62  7.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example students can write long documents or reports faster and in an easy way

SI127E-01383-P50020 1 SI127E-01383  0.00  5.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion times are changing and there are a lot of people that have started learning virtually
SI127E-01383-P50020 1 SI127E-01383  5.89 10.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it has been proved that both methods have their own advantages
SI127E-01383-P50020 1 SI127E-01383 10.33 19.43 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it'll depend on each student which one to choose maybe depending on their likes and preferences

SI127E-01399-P50021 1 SI127E-01399  9.84 14.04 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and then i think for example the weather
SI127E-01399-P50021 1 SI127E-01399 14.04 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> you go to for example poland the weather in gran canaria and poland is completely different

SI127E-01399-P50022 1 SI127E-01399 10.49 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but i think the most important is the food because food is an important part of the culture in every place
SI127E-01399-P50023 1 SI127E-01399  0.00 17.81 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think it's true because last year i went on the erasmus scheme and when i got back home i had become independent from my family because one year in another country you change completely

SI127E-01409-P30017 1 SI127E-01409  0.00 10.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think a period of practical work experience is the best way to find out what you want to do in the future
SI127E-01409-P30017 1 SI127E-01409 10.27 33.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my case for example i didn't know if i wanted to be a lawyer or if i wanted to be in human resources so i started my internship in a company and it was fantastic
SI127E-01409-P30017 1 SI127E-01409 33.29 35.52 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it was the best experience for me
SI127E-01409-P30017 1 SI127E-01409 35.52 54.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however one of the disadvantages was that i needed to go to the company to be in the practice but i needed to go to the university as well to go class
SI127E-01409-P30017 1 SI127E-01409 54.86 59.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so this was the worst experience

SI127E-01409-P40018 1 SI127E-01409 45.38 59.53 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so tunes net is the best one because it started very badly and now is increasing and increasing a lot

SI127E-01528-P10006 1 SI127E-01528  0.00 12.17 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in my holidays i often go to the park to play soccer with my friends who are majoring in engineering which is the same as me

SI127E-01528-P10008 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  1.71 <o,Q5,B1,P1> oh that's a good question
SI127E-01528-P10008 1 SI127E-01528  1.71  4.57 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in the future i would like to be an airline pilot
SI127E-01528-P10008 1 SI127E-01528  4.57 19.46 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so there are two reasons i want to be an airline pilot and the first one is i like to control something and the second one is i like to be a member of a team

SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528  0.00 26.99 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so there are two advantages that students who get jobs to pay for their university studies have and the first one is students can improve their like communication skills in the job the part time job and the second one is that they can learn about how to manage money
SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528 26.99 42.44 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that if they have so much like work it's gonna be they don't have much time to study which is the most important thing for a student
SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528 42.44 52.30 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and in my opinion students should get jobs
SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528 52.30 59.87 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i mean you know like communication skills and experience in the job are very useful and important for society
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  7.11 <o,Q5,B1,P4> all right so i am talking about what you need to do to travel by airplane
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528  7.11 12.54 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so there are one two three four five six seven eight procedures
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 12.54 21.01 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and the first step is that you travel to the airport by car by bus or by train
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 21.01 30.25 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then when you arrive at the airport you have to check in at the counter
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 30.25 37.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and you have to show your documents and the people at the counter check the documents
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 37.91 43.88 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then also you have to pass a security check
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 43.88 52.89 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then you have time to wait to like take a rest or have a coffee
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 52.89 59.87 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then after that you will board the airplane and then enjoy your flight
SI127E-01528-P50019 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  6.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> okay so i'm talking about how we can use technology more effectively to study
SI127E-01528-P50019 1 SI127E-01528  6.38 16.96 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and i think the best way to use technology to study is to use like an application on a smartphone

SI127E-01528-P50020 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  2.27 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah i agree with that
SI127E-01528-P50020 1 SI127E-01528  2.27 12.37 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i mean you know face to face like studying and learning is really good for like communication with other people

SI127E-01528-P50021 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  6.54 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in group projects a student can get communication skills
SI127E-01528-P50021 1 SI127E-01528  6.54 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example like if there is someone who doesn't know about something and someone can teach them that is good

SI127E-01528-P50022 1 SI127E-01528 17.45 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> so it's easy to do it
SI127E-01528-P50023 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  9.16 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think it is not so important to have modern learning facilities in the school

SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573  0.00 10.45 <o,Q5,B2,P3> like every decision in life when we work while we are studying at university there are some advantages and disadvantages
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 10.45 26.26 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one good advantage is when you are working and studying at the same time you can use the theory you've learnt and knowledge that you are getting when you are studying and put it into practice when you work
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 26.26 34.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> at the same time that part time work will give you some economic resources that you can use in your daily life
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 34.20 37.89 <o,Q5,B2,P3> on the other hand it has some disadvantages as well
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 37.89 47.31 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example you have less time to spend with your friends you have less time to study and you have less time to practice sport
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 47.31 59.42 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so in my opinion it's all about finding a good balance between your part time job your study time and your work time

SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 33.41 37.64 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but there are a lot of disadvantages
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 37.64 48.68 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example you won't be able to spend the time that you would like to with your friends or you will be stressed in the future

SI127E-01961-P10008 1 SI127E-01961 10.14 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would like to just speak another language like chinese
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 16.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> one of the advantages of working as a student it's to be financially independent and also to know how the professional environment works and how to manage different environments
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 16.82 20.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> but there are also drawbacks to this
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 20.95 26.79 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example one of the most inconvenient things is we can be tired
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 26.79 33.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> i mean students could be tired from their part time jobs
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 33.30 42.23 <o,Q5,C,P3> it depends on the job that they do delivering or shopping or whatever

SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 56.25 59.98 <o,Q5,C,P3> but it has to be short
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961  0.00  7.69 <o,Q4,C,P4> acid rain is one of the most damaging phenomena for the environment today
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961  7.69 12.56 <o,Q4,C,P4> but how does this form in the environment

SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 20.27 27.06 <o,Q4,C,P4> these particles in smoke form smog that spreads in the air
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 27.06 33.16 <o,Q4,C,P4> some of them continue their journey to mix with clouds
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 33.16 41.41 <o,Q4,C,P4> just a reminder that clouds are made up of water and acid particles become a part of the clouds
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 41.41 59.98 <o,Q4,C,P4> consequently depending on the temperature rain or snow may contain a large number of particles and acid particles which leads to acid rain or acid snow which can be really damaging to the environment
SI127E-01961-P50019 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 18.81 <o,Q5,C,P5> a healthier lifestyle starts with nutrition and as far as i'm concerned we must stop eating between meals and drink a lot of water like about one point five litres a day or two litres per day
SI127E-01961-P50019 1 SI127E-01961 18.81 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> whatever
SI127E-01961-P50020 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 14.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> our bodies are made up of ninety percent water so we should keep that level all day because this is where our bodies get all their energy
SI127E-01961-P50020 1 SI127E-01961 14.13 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> so we should drink a lot of water about two litres per day
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961  0.00  5.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> the more we sleep the longer we live
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961  5.80 13.12 <o,Q5,C,P5> so in my opinion we should keep a constant eight hours of sleep each night
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961 13.12 18.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> and even ten hours would be perfect for an adult for example
SI127E-01961-P50023 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 13.57 <o,Q5,C,P5> the advantage of technology is that now we can track every aspect of our bodies and our health and we don't have to go to the doctor all the time
SI127E-01961-P50023 1 SI127E-01961 13.57 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> but the other side is we're so dependent on that
SI127E-01965-P10006 1 SI127E-01965  0.00  5.23 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i usually enjoy spending my free time by dancing
SI127E-01965-P10006 1 SI127E-01965  5.23 12.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i tend to watch choreographies and learn them by watching videos and slowing them down
SI127E-01965-P10006 1 SI127E-01965 12.86 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that way i can really learn the details and dance them with my partner

SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965  6.57 13.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> firstly the advantages i see in studying and doing part time jobs would be that they will have way more money to do things in their free time and to pay for their study fees
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 13.32 31.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand we have the disadvantages
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 31.27 34.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> one big important disadvantage would be having less time to study which could lead to having lower grades
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 34.47 47.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it will be a bit more difficult
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 47.54 51.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it would be a really good thing to have part time jobs while studying so they can have more money

SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 19.70 28.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the wind makes some acid particles fall as dust which could lead to the rivers and some lakes being less clean
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 28.03 41.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the other acid particles will mix with cloud water which could lead to rain and snow with acid particles in it which will lead to damage to the environment and kill some living things such as trees

SI127E-01965-P50019 1 SI127E-01965  0.00 14.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i would recommend going to a nutritionist so they can tell them exactly what they need and what their body needs to have for maximum energy throughout the day
SI127E-01965-P50021 1 SI127E-01965  0.00  4.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think we need to do exercise every day
SI127E-01965-P50021 1 SI127E-01965  4.07 15.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think it's very important to do exercise at least two or three times a week so our body can keep its shape and to be a healthy weight
SI127E-01965-P50023 1 SI127E-01965  0.00 12.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> generally technology has really improved our health because we don't have to waste as much energy as we used to with our new technology
SI127E-01965-P50023 1 SI127E-01965 12.86 17.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think it is an improvement
SI127E-01981-P10005 1 SI127E-01981  0.00  7.44 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm so interested because you can learn about other cultures
SI127E-01981-P10005 1 SI127E-01981  7.44 13.12 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i think it is positive in every way
SI127E-01981-P10007 1 SI127E-01981  0.00 15.17 <o,Q5,B1,P1> maybe the best way is talking with other people from england or the united states and you can learn a lot about english
SI127E-01981-P10008 1 SI127E-01981  0.00  5.10 <o,Q4,B1,P1> maybe the italian language
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981  0.00 19.07 <o,Q5,B1,P3> some advantages of having jobs while you are studying are that you maybe see real life and you can afford to pay for some things and that will maybe help your parents with the university fees
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 19.07 31.29 <o,Q5,B1,P3> on the other hand some disadvantages are that you don't have too much time for study and you will sleep less
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 31.29 44.79 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but in my opinion you are going to learn more about responsibilities and meet other people other workpeople
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 44.79 50.49 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so definitely it's a good way to spend your time

SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 18.49 29.59 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and finally we find that particles are in the clouds of the planet because they are carried by the wind

SI128D-00108-P30017 1 SI128D-00108  8.43 23.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> advantages a clear advantage besides the money you will earn one great advantage is you will have some independence in your life and you will not depend on your parents

SI12BD-00039-P50019 1 SI12BD-00039  4.54 12.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if they are really addicted to it they should start small and then aim higher
SI12BD-00039-P50019 1 SI12BD-00039 12.77 18.85 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and i also think a gluten free diet is better

SI12BD-00039-P50020 1 SI12BD-00039  9.57 14.08 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and it really helps homeostasis
SI12BD-00039-P50020 1 SI12BD-00039 14.08 15.85 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is great

SI12BD-00041-P30017 1 SI12BD-00041 28.01 43.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the disadvantage is that normally you don't have time to do all the activities or assignments that you must do

SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 21.17 43.31 <o,Q4,B1,P3> firstly we have to know that university is difficult so we have to have enough time to do our homework hang with friends and have the freedom to go out and spend some time with your classmates and of course you have to study for your exams
SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042 43.31 54.58 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so having a part time job could waste your time and maybe you won't be able to study enough

SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042  6.52 17.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain is a common problem nowadays and we have to find a way of eliminating it
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 17.35 21.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the vehicles and the factories as we all know cause pollution
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 21.38 30.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this pollution usually creates acid particles that go into the smoke of these factories
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 30.92 39.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> these acid particles could be carried by wind and could also mix with water in the clouds
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 39.33 56.58 <o,Q4,B2,P4> if this happens then acid rain is going to fall onto the ground and damage the environment as well as humans animals and the fields of the farmers for example

SI12BD-00042-P50021 1 SI12BD-00042  5.92 15.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> of course if we are too busy we can just skip the exercise and do it the next day

SI12BD-00042-P50022 1 SI12BD-00042  5.31 15.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i completely agree with this statement because we have to be healthy also in our sleep

SI12BD-00089-P50019 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00  5.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that first of all the most important thing is the safety of that country
SI12BD-00089-P50019 1 SI12BD-00089  5.98 12.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> after that it should be the climate of the country whether it is suitable for the student

SI12BD-00089-P50020 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well the benefit of that is that first of all you can really know how to speak a second language and after that in lots of foreign countries the culture is so different and it's a joy to learn another language to know their culture through that
SI12BD-00089-P50021 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00 13.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well first of all the difficulty must come from the influence of the culture because there are so many different habits of other countries' people
SI12BD-00089-P50021 1 SI12BD-00089 13.39 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also the difficulty may be because of the language of course
SI12BD-00089-P50022 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00  9.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well the fastest way for a student to learn about the local culture is to become friends with some local people
SI12BD-00089-P50022 1 SI12BD-00089  9.55 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and in that case they can take you to maybe their festivals and in that case you can learn about the culture
SI12BD-00089-P50023 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with that idea because when you study in another country it's most likely that you are on your own and you have to do everything by yourself because there are no parents alongside you and so in that case you can become more independent

SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095  0.00 12.45 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the main advantage is that they are going to be able to pay their student loans and this is going to give them a sense of responsibility
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 12.45 27.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i also think that there are some disadvantages to it that is that the time that they are going to spend on those jobs they aren't going to be able to use for studying
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 27.55 37.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and well studying is very important for getting a better job in the future so it could be a downside
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 37.92 54.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's a good thing having a job and not just because of the money but also because of the future prospects that the students will have about their future jobs
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 54.70 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they will have their first experience of how it is going to be

SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 17.23 29.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> for example we are not able to travel with metallic gadgets or any kind of weapons

SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 33.18 42.73 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we have arrived two hours before take off we are going to have a quiet time a lot of time to wait
SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 42.73 53.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we can spend it in the cafeteria restaurants or any kind of gift shop that there are in the airport

SI12BD-00095-P50020 1 SI12BD-00095  0.00 15.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i have experienced both sides of both and i would say that maybe face to face learning or school is better than the one online

SI12BD-00110-P50020 1 SI12BD-00110  0.00 16.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it is very important because it can open some doors and opportunities for the students if the students can speak two or maybe three languages for their future professions

SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 13.00 16.30 <o,Q4,C,P3> so you gain experience in the area
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 16.30 25.53 <o,Q4,C,P3> and you also get to know people who are working in this area and you can do some networking in the field
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 25.53 38.48 <o,Q4,C,P3> well i also think that it has disadvantages coz working and studying requires time and is a huge responsibility which could be so stressful
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 38.48 59.98 <o,Q4,C,P3> in the end i think that it is very useful and students should do part time jobs while they are studying because in the end it has a positive impact on your experience and it could help you to find a job
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135  0.00  3.21 <o,Q4,B2,P4> today we're gonna talk about acid rain
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135  3.21  6.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain is caused by pollution
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135  6.82 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this pollution is principally emitted by factories and vehicles and we're talking about smoke
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 15.70 24.24 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this smoke has some acid particles in it and these acid particles are carried by wind

SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 45.70 59.98 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this acid rain is toxic so it has severe consequences for our environment because it damages not only our plants but also microorganisms in our soil
SI12BD-00135-P50019 1 SI12BD-00135  0.00  7.10 <o,Q4,B2,P5> my advice to these people is that they plan their meals
SI12BD-00135-P50019 1 SI12BD-00135  7.10 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it could help you to be prepared when you are hungry and not fill up with this junk food that you can find in the streets
SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135  0.00  4.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's difficult to determine how much is a lot
SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135  4.30 10.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but the recommendation is that you should drink at least two liters of water every day
SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135 10.56 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's what our body needs to maintain hydration

SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135  1.72  6.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion it is vital to do exercise every day
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135  6.69 11.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the recommendation is to do at least thirty minutes of exercise
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135 11.71 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> this can improve our health in a good way
SI12BD-00135-P50022 1 SI12BD-00135  0.00  3.48 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that everybody is different
SI12BD-00135-P50022 1 SI12BD-00135  3.48 13.87 <o,Q4,B2,P5> someone can need just six hours of sleep and someone else can need nine hours of sleep

SI12BD-00150-P10005 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 18.37 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am interested in learning about other countries so much because i think learning more about other countries can give me a deeper insight into other cultures and broaden my horizons
SI12BD-00150-P10006 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy spending my free time reading books watching movies watching drama series and going out with my friends
SI12BD-00150-P10007 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> as for improving my oral english i think it is better to speak as much as possible with your foreign friends and read as much as possible too
SI12BD-00150-P10008 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00  9.88 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it would be cooking because cooking is an important skill for independent life
SI12BD-00150-P10008 1 SI12BD-00150  9.88 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and through cooking i can make delicious meals for my family to spread happiness and well being
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 21.38 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think the advantages are students can get more practical skills and combine what they have learned in their textbooks with their experiences through doing part time jobs
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 21.38 33.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are that they may be easily distracted from class leading to poor grades
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 33.61 40.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think it is better to strike a balance between doing part time jobs and studying
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 40.17 60.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and students should choose the most appropriate part time jobs for themselves because part time jobs vary from person to person and they should choose their individual jobs
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 17.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> pollution given off from factories and vehicles contains smoke which acid particles are in
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 17.35 21.61 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they are carried by the wind
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 21.61 39.19 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some of them fall as dust and others mix with cloud water to form rain or snow which is also called acid rain
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 39.19 60.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and acid rain can do harm to the environment which has raised people's awareness of it
SI12BD-00150-P50019 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00  9.66 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it is persistence and self discipline

SI12BD-00150-P50022 1 SI12BD-00150  3.35 20.78 <o,Q4,B2,P5> enough sleep can refresh your mind after a busy day and get you well prepared for the next day and sleep deprivation can make you stressed the next day
SI12BD-00162-P10005 1 SI12BD-00162  0.00 13.13 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i'm very interested in other countries because i really like other cultures and i like visiting them

SI12BD-00162-P10007 1 SI12BD-00162  0.00 13.49 <o,Q5,B1,P1> this is a difficult question because i think that there exist a lot of methods for learning english

SI12BD-00162-P30017 1 SI12BD-00162  0.00 21.60 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think that this is a controversial topic because it has a lot of advantages and also it has disadvantages
SI12BD-00162-P30017 1 SI12BD-00162 21.60 45.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example you can make money if you work while you are studying but you spend a lot of time and this time you should spend studying if you want to pass the university exams
SI12BD-00162-P30017 1 SI12BD-00162 45.61 59.87 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for this reason i think that it's better if you don't work while you are studying but if you need the money you should work
SI12BD-00162-P40018 1 SI12BD-00162  0.00  6.12 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i'm going to talk about acid rain

SI12BD-00164-P10005 1 SI12BD-00164  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it's well known that the environment needs to be healthy for our future and we need to keep nature healthy and try to stop the pollution and contamination of the environment
SI12BD-00164-P10006 1 SI12BD-00164  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> my friends and i like to spend the time going to the cinema and going to restaurants or sometimes i host a dinner for them and we start to talk about our families our goals and catch up with each other
SI12BD-00164-P10007 1 SI12BD-00164  0.00 13.35 <o,Q3,B1,P1> in my view the most similar to me is my mother because she has the same love for music classical music and orchestral music
SI12BD-00164-P10007 1 SI12BD-00164 13.35 19.94 <o,Q3,B1,P1> so we sometimes spend time listening to that kind of music and we enjoy it very much

SI12BD-00164-P30017 1 SI12BD-00164 27.88 41.84 <o,Q4,B1,P3> on other hand one of the disadvantages would be that time they spend on fitness classes will not be used for feeding their brains

SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164  9.97 17.81 <o,Q4,B1,P4> bees collect the nectar from flowers and secondly the bees make honey from nectar in beehives

SI12BD-00164-P40018 1 SI12BD-00164 32.02 41.13 <o,Q4,B1,P4> those honey jars are organized and then distributed for the company

SI12BD-00164-P50021 1 SI12BD-00164  0.00 10.22 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my experience the most difficult thing about studying in another country is you are so far from your family

SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292  7.37 29.20 <o,Q5,B1,P3> for example the advantages are that the students who work know the effort that it takes to pay their universities and this is a positive point
SI12BD-00292-P30017 1 SI12BD-00292 29.20 44.23 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but a disadvantage for example is that they can't dedicate all the time to study and their marks can be worse

SI12BD-00376-P30017 1 SI12BD-00376 56.36 59.87 <o,Q4,A2,P3> this is my opinion
SI12BD-00376-P40018 1 SI12BD-00376  0.00 14.85 <o,Q4,A2,P4> to travel by plane first you go to the airport and check in

SI12BD-00376-P40018 1 SI12BD-00376 46.94 60.04 <o,Q4,A2,P4> it is very very important that you pass the document control because it is necessary

SI12BD-00398-P10005 1 SI12BD-00398  0.00  7.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> my favourite time is autumn because autumn is a very comfortable season
SI12BD-00398-P10005 1 SI12BD-00398  7.20 12.12 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in this season it's not very hot nor very cold

SI12BD-00398-P10006 1 SI12BD-00398  0.00  4.81 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think reading the news every day is very important
SI12BD-00398-P10006 1 SI12BD-00398  4.81 10.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we need to understand what is happening in our surroundings every day

SI12BD-00398-P10008 1 SI12BD-00398  5.25 10.39 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so maybe in the future i will choose a job related to my major

SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398  0.00  5.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think this topic has both advantages and disadvantages
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398  5.08 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> speaking of advantages maybe university students can get more work experience through the practical work process
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 16.38 30.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but students wouldn't have too much time to work in the university and for students in the university maybe the most important task is study
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 30.67 40.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they need to focus on their classes to get more professional knowledge about their major
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 40.55 46.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so maybe sometimes they can't balance the time for study and working
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 46.98 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think maybe some university classes can include some practical work experience but not all of them

SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 11.71 <o,Q4,C,P3> i do not agree with the statement that all university students should do part time jobs
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 11.71 17.64 <o,Q4,C,P3> there is an advantage of doing a part time job as a student
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 17.64 30.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> obviously you can learn how to earn money and obviously as a student you need to spend a lot of money on tuition fees and your daily life
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 30.41 33.92 <o,Q4,C,P3> but on the other hand you have to balance your time
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 33.92 38.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> you have to study in the library
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 38.22 42.65 <o,Q4,C,P3> if you're a student the main thing you've got to do is studying
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 42.65 54.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> so if you have enough money and your focus is on studying a subject you do not have to do a part time job
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 54.95 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> so this is the reason why i do not agree with the statement
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 12.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so here's how acid rain is caused and eventually damages the environment
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 12.29 28.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all acid particles are created via emission of pollution from factories and vehicles and other sources
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 28.92 44.50 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then acid particles in smoke go up in the air and in thr air acid particles are carried by wind and form clouds
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 44.50 54.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some acid falls directly to the ground and damages the soil or ponds rivers and oceans

SI12BD-00499-P50019 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think a good eating habit is eating breakfast lunch and dinner at the same time every day and not eating too many sweets or drinking alcohol
SI12BD-00499-P50020 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it is extremely important to drink water regularly instead of drinking only coffee or alcohol and sugary beverages because it dehydrates your body
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's not essential to do exercise every single day but it is important to do some exercise
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499 10.04 17.61 <o,Q4,C,P5> it depends on your age your gender and what level of health you're looking for
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499 17.61 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> but certainly doing exercise is good for you
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 11.40 <o,Q4,C,P5> i do not necessarily agree that every single person needs eight hours of sleep every day
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499 11.40 18.29 <o,Q4,C,P5> on average it would be good to have eight hours' sleep but again depending on the person
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499 18.29 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> you may only need six hours
SI12BD-00535-P10005 1 SI12BD-00535  0.00 11.57 <o,Q4,C,P1> i see the environment as a pretty serious issue coz nowadays people tend to create a lot of waste
SI12BD-00535-P10005 1 SI12BD-00535 11.57 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P1> so normally when i go out i bring my own bottle my own container for food et cetera

SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 10.24 31.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> the negative points the disadvantages are the students may get too tired after the exercises and they will become very sweaty so that the classroom will fill with bad smells
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 31.21 53.67 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand the advantages are the students may be able to keep fit and to be more able to focus on what they are learning coz there's a study saying that exercise can help people to get focused
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 53.67 58.79 <o,Q5,C,P3> and they will become effective learners

SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535  6.47 11.20 <o,Q5,C,P4> there are six steps for this
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 11.20 14.29 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it goes from the flower to the shop
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 14.29 20.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> so first of all the bees have to collect nectar from the flowers
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 20.84 26.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that they will make honey from nectar in beehives
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 26.88 36.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> after they make the honey the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then put it into jars
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 36.68 48.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that the jars will be shipped to the supermarkets or the stores that sell the honey
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 48.04 57.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> and in the end the customers will get the honey from the supermarket

SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535 12.88 17.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> it might be extremely different from their home country
SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535 17.71 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> so they need time to adapt
SI12BD-00535-P50022 1 SI12BD-00535  0.00  9.34 <o,Q5,C,P5> students can learn about the local culture by making some local friends in the country
SI12BD-00535-P50022 1 SI12BD-00535  9.34 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> this way they can all hang out together so that they can experience the local culture
SI12BD-00535-P50023 1 SI12BD-00535  0.00  9.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think studying abroad indeed helps students to become more independent
SI12BD-00535-P50023 1 SI12BD-00535  9.11 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> as for me i studied abroad for a year and that made me more independent because i had to do everything on my own including cooking

SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547  5.55 26.67 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion this should be optional for the students because on the one hand the ones who don't work would have the opportunity to check out how real life works and put into practice the theory they learn in class
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 26.67 47.19 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand for those who are already working to support themselves or to support their families it would be a great disadvantage because they wouldn't be able to leave their real jobs and look for something that may not be rewarding in terms of money
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 47.19 51.75 <o,Q4,C,P3> i've been through this situation and it was really exhausting

SI12BD-01064-P10005 1 SI12BD-01064  0.00 17.73 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am very interested in the environment and also i am worried because people use a lot of plastics and we aren't concerned about this
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064  0.00  6.05 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well we love to go to the cinema in summer go to the beach
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064  6.05  8.82 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but the summer is a little different
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064  8.82 17.92 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but we love to go out together and go running or do other sports

SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064  0.00 18.45 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well in my opinion the advantage of doing fitness classes in school time is that all students can practice a sport and so they are healthier
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 18.45 40.33 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that in school they need to reduce their time on other subjects maybe maths or maybe languages or i don't know but they need to reduce another subject
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 40.33 57.20 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion it's a good idea because children and teenagers usually don't practise sport and it's very important for their health
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 57.20 59.87 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so it's a good idea

SI12BD-01070-P30017 1 SI12BD-01070  5.14 16.71 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion these kinds of measures ensure that the students acquire the skills that they will need in their future work

SI12BD-01070-P50022 1 SI12BD-01070  0.00  7.92 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think not because some things at the moment are working remotely

SI12BD-01070-P50023 1 SI12BD-01070  0.00  9.06 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it depends because some tasks are better if only one person does it

SI131R-00030-P50022 1 SI131R-00030  0.00 11.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think attending lectures would be better because the professor and advisor will help to point out your further study direction
SI131R-00030-P50022 1 SI131R-00030 11.98 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and they can help you to reduce the stress of study or something
SI131R-00030-P50023 1 SI131R-00030  0.00  7.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> modern learning facilities could bring advanced knowledge around the world

SI131R-00030-P50023 1 SI131R-00030 15.96 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think it's very important
SI131R-00045-P10005 1 SI131R-00045  0.00  6.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i believe that learning about other countries and their culture is very important
SI131R-00045-P10005 1 SI131R-00045  6.62 19.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> since i am a teacher i consider it to be really important because in this way you know the people and how they work

SI131R-00045-P10007 1 SI131R-00045  0.00 15.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> from my perspective the best way to improve your english is to use it in a real way for example speaking with people whose first language is english

SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045  0.00 11.82 <o,Q4,B2,P3> having a part time job during your university studies can bring some advantages and some disadvantages
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 11.82 20.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a disadvantage could be that you can have less time to do your homework for example
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 20.88 44.53 <o,Q4,B2,P3> an advantage could be that if your part time job is related to your career then it will help you because you will apply what you are learning in the university and if it doesn't work you can learn from that experience
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 44.53 51.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion it's very important for students to have a part time job
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 51.24 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however this part time job must be related to their bachelor's degrees so they will learn more
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045  0.00  6.26 <o,Q5,C,P4> it is well known that rain is a natural phenomenon
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045  6.26 11.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> however factories and vehicles produce pollution
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 11.56 16.36 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this pollution is mainly acid particles in smoke
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 16.36 19.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and these particles are carried by the wind
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 19.84 24.63 <o,Q5,C,P4> and some particles fall as dust
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 24.63 48.99 <o,Q5,C,P4> on the other hand there're other particles that mix with the clouds and these clouds producing water or snow make these acid particles fall on the trees on the animals even on our cars
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 48.99 58.33 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this can be harmful and it damages nature
SI131R-00045-P50020 1 SI131R-00045  0.00 11.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> since our bodies are made up of ninety six percent water it's very important that we drink water
SI131R-00045-P50020 1 SI131R-00045 11.37 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however as you said before drinking lots of water can be very harmful
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045  0.00  8.06 <o,Q5,B2,P5> maybe doing exercise every day can be excessive if you are a beginner in this field
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045  8.06 15.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however maybe three days per week can be very effective if you want to have a healthy life
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045 15.55 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and then you can go on and work harder

SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048  0.00 22.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think university students want to pay for their own studies because it's really difficult for families to get the amount of the money that you need to pay for your studies
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 22.86 30.31 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so the advantage is well you are independent of your family and are financially independent
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 30.31 40.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage is obviously you have less time to study so that's not good for your degree
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 40.92 58.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's more important the independence and not to be a burden on your family so you need to have a job and be able to pay for your own studies

SI131R-00048-P50022 1 SI131R-00048  0.00 13.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it depends because on some occasions when you attend lectures you learn a lot because the teacher is good at his job
SI131R-00048-P50022 1 SI131R-00048 13.63 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but on other occasions attending lectures is not effective because it's the same as reading alone
SI131R-00048-P50023 1 SI131R-00048  0.00  8.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's important because the way that the students learn is changing all the time
SI131R-00048-P50023 1 SI131R-00048  8.20 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that's important to modernise your style of teaching to be attractive for the students

SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 13.54 22.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in the future they can add it on their c vs so businesses hire them

SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 38.22 48.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and if you are working obviously you aren't gonna have all the time to dedicate to your degree

SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274  8.31 21.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> depending on the facilities of the city you could go by tram or train by bus or on your own or by taxi or your own car

SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 47.47 58.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you pass the security control probably you will have to wait in a waiting area or you can go to a cafe

SI131R-00274-P50019 1 SI131R-00274 12.41 19.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i could bring my ipad to the bed and study my notes keeping warm in my bed
SI131R-00274-P50020 1 SI131R-00274  0.00  7.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well obviously it depends on the teacher and the subject that you are studying
SI131R-00274-P50020 1 SI131R-00274  7.30 16.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but in my own experience i will say that i prefer a book rather than a teacher
SI131R-00274-P50021 1 SI131R-00274  0.00  7.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so first of all if you work in groups you'll have to deal with people

SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291  6.04 19.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> i firmly believe that taking a short time per day to do some exercise would be really beneficial for students to help them be active
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 19.41 32.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> and as well there are also some disadvantages like for example schools will have less time for doing their lessons like for example science
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 32.14 39.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> and another part would be that maybe some students won't want to do any exercise
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 39.02 42.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> so they will lose time at school
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 42.22 57.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> but despite all these advantages and disadvantages i firmly believe that this idea is really good and it should be recognized by schools and schools should take part and go ahead

SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 17.44 29.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they collect the nectar and they bring the nectar to their home where they make honey from nectar in beehives

SI131R-00345-P50023 1 SI131R-00345  0.00 13.44 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the technology is very good because it helps with running

SI131R-00372-P10005 1 SI131R-00372  0.00  8.83 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i live in a big flat which is near to the centre of the town
SI131R-00372-P10005 1 SI131R-00372  8.83 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and the dining room is very big
SI131R-00372-P10006 1 SI131R-00372  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i really like spending time with my friends going for a walk or listening to music sometimes watching a film or reading an interesting book you know
SI131R-00372-P10007 1 SI131R-00372  0.00  3.45 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my only brother
SI131R-00372-P10007 1 SI131R-00372  3.45 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> he's very special and we really like going for a walk you know around the forest or talking about any kind of issue or topic
SI131R-00372-P10008 1 SI131R-00372  0.00 19.60 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i would love to be a teacher because i really like teaching kids and i'd also like to have you know really long holidays in summer
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372  0.00 17.20 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think that one of the advantages is that if you don't have a lot of time to study you concentrate better and your time is used more effectively
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 17.20 17.95 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you know
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 17.95 27.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and on the other hand you will be exhausted with no time for your friends
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 27.38 34.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think you have to be very careful if you get a job while you're studying
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 34.65 47.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion if you can don't work at the same time but sometimes life challenges us
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 47.67 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so then i can tell you go for it and study and work like it's the best thing you can do

SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372  8.64 24.20 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all you have to go to the airport in some form of transport like by car or by bus or train
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 24.20 40.84 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you arrive at the airport and it's time to do the check in pass through document control and then the security guards will see if everything is okay
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 40.84 43.57 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you have to wait in the waiting area
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 43.57 51.10 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you can have something to eat or go to the bathroom or restroom or have a coffee
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 51.10 60.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and finally they will call you to board and it's time for the plane to take off
SI131R-00372-P50019 1 SI131R-00372  0.00 13.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so they can search for information on the internet to improve their knowledge

SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374  5.53 12.58 <o,Q3,B2,P3> i mean one of the advantages is they would know the outside world as it is
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 12.58 17.43 <o,Q3,B2,P3> a disadvantage would be that they wouldn't have time to focus on their studies

SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 18.74 23.55 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but in my own opinion most of the students there are not able to pay for their college
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 23.55 25.64 <o,Q3,B2,P3> they are already doing part time jobs

SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475  8.54 10.53 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i have two reasons
SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475 10.53 19.87 <o,Q4,B1,P3> first we should focus on study in universities

SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475  0.00  9.14 <o,Q4,B1,P4> okay i will tell you about travelling by airplane
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475  9.14 20.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first you arrive at the airport with transportation like a car or a bus or train
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 20.93 37.39 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then you have to check in and you go to document control to check your bags and luggage
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 37.39 52.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> third step you should wait in the hall and you can go to the bathroom and eat lunch

SI131R-00475-P50019 1 SI131R-00475  0.00 16.02 <o,Q4,B1,P5> we can use technology instead of our brain because i think we use the brain only to consider
SI131R-00475-P50020 1 SI131R-00475  0.00 14.22 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think face to face is important because we can communicate with people face to face
SI131R-00475-P50020 1 SI131R-00475 14.22 19.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> we express our feelings
SI131R-00475-P50022 1 SI131R-00475  0.00  8.13 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think attending a lecture is better than studying alone

SI131R-00475-P50023 1 SI131R-00475  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it is necessary to provide modern learning facilities because we must keep up with the times so we can get knowledge
SI131R-00512-P10005 1 SI131R-00512  0.00 13.48 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i am really interested in learning about other countries because for my career i need to learn about other cultures how they deal with bargains and all these things
SI131R-00512-P10005 1 SI131R-00512 13.48 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i prefer to take advantage of knowing about these cultures when making my deals
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  4.26 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm keen on doing exercise
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512  4.26  5.99 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's really important for me
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512  5.99 17.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example i go to the gym and do some exercise with the dumbbells and well i feel stronger and feel good about myself
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512 17.03 20.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so for me it's incredible
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  4.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i get a buzz from listening to music
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512  4.29 15.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's incredible because you can put your headphones on and improve your skills in english because you can listen to some words that you never heard before in your life
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 15.63 18.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so that is the best way to learn
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 18.57 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and maybe reading
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  8.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i would prefer to learn gymnastics rather than learn about i don't know other topics
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512  8.91 16.85 <o,Q4,B2,P1> because it's very important for me that with these movements i feel great about myself and about my body
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512 16.85 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to reach my limits
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  4.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> many students at the moment do part time jobs
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512  4.16  9.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> this has many advantages
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512  9.07 19.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you can develop new skills and the things that professional environment wants from other people and improve your knowledge about the things that you learn in the school
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 19.75 29.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantages of this are that there are many students who don't have time or maybe are not sufficiently organised to do these things
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 29.60 32.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and it's difficult for many people yes
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 32.62 50.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however in my opinion you need to do this and take the risk to do both things because in the future many companies will be impressed by your story about how you know all these things
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 50.50 57.69 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and well you can say ah well i was a student and an employee
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 57.69 60.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i can do both

SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 44.55 55.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they could suffer some dramatic situations because the environment is not the best for us at the moment
SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 55.35 59.98 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we need to save the environment and clean things
SI131R-00512-P50020 1 SI131R-00512  0.00 11.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i recommend people drink one point five liters of water every single day to be hydrated and feel comfortable in themselves

SI131R-00597-P10006 1 SI131R-00597  0.00  4.09 <o,Q4,C,P1> it depends where i go for the holiday
SI131R-00597-P10006 1 SI131R-00597  4.09 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P1> but if it's a beach i prefer sometimes to stay in the hotel and enjoy all the experiences the hotel gives us but when it's to a city i prefer getting to know the city more

SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 11.61 32.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> like it's great if we can help out our parents with some money because i know that sometimes it can get really stressful for our parents to pay for our studies coz university it's very expensive everywhere
SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 32.12 40.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i also think that we have to just help them out
SI131R-00597-P30017 1 SI131R-00597 40.52 52.32 <o,Q5,C,P3> but some of the disadvantages are that sometimes we can get really stressed with that and we can end up with lower grades

SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597  6.51 10.45 <o,Q5,C,P4> and first you have to get to the airport
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 10.45 15.70 <o,Q5,C,P4> you have to go by bus by car by whatever you want
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 15.70 29.65 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to do a check in because that's the way that you say that you are there on time and they register all your suitcases
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 29.65 32.33 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to go to a document control
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 32.33 40.75 <o,Q5,C,P4> then pass the security because they don't allow a lot of items like weapons and knives
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 40.75 49.37 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to go to an area where you have to wait till you can board the airplane
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 49.37 57.32 <o,Q5,C,P4> and finally you board the airplane and then you are ready to go to your destination

SI131R-00597-P50019 1 SI131R-00597  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that technology has given us a lot of good ways to study and one way we can use technology is we can record ourselves and then listen again to the recording to memorise everything more easily and quickly
SI131R-00597-P50020 1 SI131R-00597  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i agree with them because when we have virtual classes we don't pay as much attention as when we have a face to face class with a professor coz we don't feel the pressure of having to give a hundred percent in the class
SI131R-00597-P50021 1 SI131R-00597  0.00 18.20 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the most important skill that we develop is that we get to improve our communication and also to be very patient with our friends because sometimes we get very stressed when they don't do anything
SI131R-00597-P50021 1 SI131R-00597 18.20 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> and yeah
SI131R-00597-P50022 1 SI131R-00597  0.00 16.42 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think reading alone is better because we are focused on what we are reading and when we attend lectures i think that we lose a little bit of the focus on what we are studying

SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629  9.31 15.49 <o,Q4,C,P4> and the stages you need to follow to travel by plane are as follows
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 15.49 21.04 <o,Q4,C,P4> first you have to travel to the airport by car by bus by train
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 21.04 24.88 <o,Q4,C,P4> and then you have to check in with your company
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 24.88 30.42 <o,Q4,C,P4> then pass document control with the police and a security control
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 30.42 33.66 <o,Q4,C,P4> they check your bags
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 33.66 40.84 <o,Q4,C,P4> after that you have to wait for the boarding time for your plane
SI131R-00629-P40018 1 SI131R-00629 40.84 48.27 <o,Q4,C,P4> then board and then the plane flies to your destination
SI131R-00629-P50020 1 SI131R-00629  0.00 11.75 <o,Q4,C,P5> i really agree with that statement because teachers have the knowledge and have the skill to pass on their own knowledge so that's a very important skill

SI131R-00693-P30017 1 SI131R-00693 28.98 43.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand if one spends most of the time doing part time jobs that could reduce the time spent studying

SI137O-00035-P30017 1 SI137O-00035 12.07 19.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's very very interesting because they can say i can work in whatever i want

SI137O-00035-P40018 1 SI137O-00035 28.70 34.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then we must pass through document control maybe we need a visa or not

SI137O-00037-P50019 1 SI137O-00037  0.00  9.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think we can use technology to search for the answer to some difficult questions that teachers may not answer

SI137O-00037-P50020 1 SI137O-00037  0.00 19.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think learning from a teacher face to face is the best way because students can learn from teachers' movements and get a better understanding and the teacher can get students' feedback very quickly and give them answers
SI137O-00037-P50021 1 SI137O-00037  0.00  4.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think there are many skills such as leadership skills

SI137O-00037-P50022 1 SI137O-00037  0.00 14.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think attending a lecture is very important because the lecturer the speaker of the lecture is also a specialist in the field and they can give you a clear understanding of this field
SI137O-00037-P50022 1 SI137O-00037 14.66 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but with books you read you can't always get the writer's point
SI137O-00037-P50023 1 SI137O-00037  0.00  9.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that's very important because students can find out how to learn from these learning facilities
SI137O-00037-P50023 1 SI137O-00037  9.74 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and teachers can get very clear feedback from students from these learning facilities
SI137O-00064-P10006 1 SI137O-00064  0.00 16.38 <o,Q5,B1,P1> normally i go to the gym or church as well and spend some time with my family watching some movies walking on the beach for instance
SI137O-00064-P10006 1 SI137O-00064 16.38 18.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> yeah

SI137O-00064-P30017 1 SI137O-00064 30.02 56.29 <o,Q5,C,P3> obviously they have some disadvantages because they will have not so much time maybe to have fun maybe sometimes to evaluate the right situations in school or maybe at work because sometimes it's not possible to deliver in the best way in both things

SI137O-00064-P40018 1 SI137O-00064 13.94 26.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so we have some particles that fall as dust and can fall as well as rain or snow and damage the environment

SI137O-00064-P50020 1 SI137O-00064  0.00  8.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's very important because water is the best drink that you can have on a daily basis
SI137O-00064-P50020 1 SI137O-00064  8.25 19.30 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so it's very important always drink water in the morning afternoon evening because it will clean your body

SI137O-00076-P50023 1 SI137O-00076  3.44 11.79 <o,Q5,B1,P5> if you are looking for results in a short time maybe sometimes a guy that's working alone will have better results

SI137O-00087-P10007 1 SI137O-00087  0.00 19.86 <o,Q4,B1,P1> the best way to improve my english will be to go to an anglophone country where i can speak english all day
SI137O-00087-P10008 1 SI137O-00087  0.00 19.86 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i want to learn english because it's a language which offers opportunity in the world and it's the most spoken language in the world

SI137O-00100-P10005 1 SI137O-00100 12.45 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's the reason why i would love to learn about foreign cultures such as indian culture
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  5.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> during my free time i love visiting museums
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100  5.20 13.56 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that learning about art and our history can explain our current situation
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100 13.56 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and thanks to living in madrid i can go to several famous museums
SI137O-00100-P10007 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  8.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> nowadays the best way for students to improve their english will be to use artificial intelligence
SI137O-00100-P10007 1 SI137O-00100  8.43 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> platforms such as this one can help students to improve the way that they speak write or their reading skills
SI137O-00100-P10008 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 15.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i had the possibility to learn a new skill definitely it would be to learn a new language maybe a language that seems difficult such as chinese or japanese
SI137O-00100-P10008 1 SI137O-00100 15.58 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> this kind of language will help us in the future
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 11.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> university students that do part time jobs are better at organising their schedules or their studying time
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100 11.61 29.57 <o,Q5,C,P3> but on the other hand it is difficult for them to focus on their exam so it would be kind of stressful during exam periods to work and study at the same time
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100 29.57 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i will say that the optimal situation would be maybe to work in a part time job that is related to your area of studying such as for example if you are studying law it will be interesting to work with a lawyer that can help you to understand better your knowledge of law
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  8.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> climate change is one of the biggest challenges that human beings are facing nowadays
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100  8.67 19.35 <o,Q5,C,P4> mainly it is caused by pollution pollution that factories emit when they are functioning
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 19.35 27.54 <o,Q5,C,P4> this pollution contains some acid particles that are both in the wind and in the clouds
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 27.54 47.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> it is important to be aware that these kinds of acid particles get into our lakes and rivers damaging the species that live there such as octopus or maybe different kinds of fish
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 47.13 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P4> and on the other hand the acid rain which is in the clouds can reach the forests damaging our trees
SI137O-00100-P50019 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> my best piece of advice in terms of eating a healthy diet will be to introduce in this diet different types of food such as vegetables cereals fresh meat
SI137O-00100-P50020 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 15.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> drinking water is a habit that really helps your body to maintain the energy that it needs to face your whole routine each day
SI137O-00100-P50020 1 SI137O-00100 15.93 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it helps your organism to work better
SI137O-00100-P50021 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  9.26 <o,Q5,C,P5> i will say that it depends on the person and lifestyle of that person
SI137O-00100-P50021 1 SI137O-00100  9.26 13.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you love doing exercise why not do it every day

SI137O-00100-P50022 1 SI137O-00100  7.47 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> but there are some studies that show that sleeping just six or seven hours per day helps as well

SI137O-00100-P50023 1 SI137O-00100  3.36 17.31 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that thanks to technology we can do several activities such as for example work from home or take some pictures of our daily life

SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102  0.00  6.12 <o,Q5,B1,P3> all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies
SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102  6.12 17.01 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think the principal advantage of this is related to the students being able to get some work experience
SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102 17.01 34.45 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but i think that the principal disadvantage is related to time because they'll lose time that they could use to improve in their studies

SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102  7.44 14.21 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if you want to travel by airplane you need to travel to the airport
SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102 14.21 32.83 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you need to enter the building and after this you have to check in because if you don't you can't fly anywhere
SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102 32.83 41.64 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after that you will need to pass document control and security
SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102 41.64 51.02 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after waiting for some hours or maybe some minutes you will be able to board the plane

SI137O-00102-P50019 1 SI137O-00102  0.00 15.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the students can use the technology to search for detailed information for example topics related to university careers
SI137O-00102-P50019 1 SI137O-00102 15.38 19.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is the way that they can use it
SI137O-00102-P50020 1 SI137O-00102  0.00 19.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think if you can do classes face to face you should do that because classes online are also good but i think face to face is better

SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120  6.79 11.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all bees collect nectar from flowers

SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 24.10 36.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put it into pots that are ready to sell
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 36.27 46.56 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these pots go to the transportation that takes them to the supermarket where people can buy them
SI137O-00120-P50019 1 SI137O-00120  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they should consider how safe the country is if the country gives resources to students from abroad and how immersed in their culture the student will be and how much he will learn
SI137O-00120-P50020 1 SI137O-00120  0.00 11.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the advantage of studying in a second language is that you can get immersed in the culture and lifestyle
SI137O-00120-P50020 1 SI137O-00120 11.57 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can learn new things develop new skills and be able to communicate with more people

SI137O-00124-P10007 1 SI137O-00124  0.00 10.39 <o,Q4,B1,P1> for me the best way to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people to travel abroad and even better to live abroad
SI137O-00124-P10008 1 SI137O-00124  0.00  4.49 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i would like to learn to play sitar

SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 24.38 37.76 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but on the other hand there are some disadvantages to it because they would not be able to concentrate on their studies

SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 45.20 58.68 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so in my opinion the students shouldn't have to work to pay for graduation from a college
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124  0.00 10.61 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well we can see in this picture how acid rain is produced

SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 27.77 33.25 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and these particles are carried by the wind
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 33.25 42.17 <o,Q4,B1,P4> some of the acid particles fall as dust and other particles mix with the cloud water
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 42.17 51.06 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then finally these acid particles fall with the rain or the snow
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 51.06 60.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so we can see in this diagram how acid rain is produced and returned to the soil

SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 17.39 38.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and as for the disadvantages i can say that while working or while doing part time jobs they cannot find perhaps enough time to study their own lessons
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 38.13 44.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so they might fail in their studies or in their exam

SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 38.10 41.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they damage the environment

SI137O-00174-P50022 1 SI137O-00174  8.37 18.92 <o,Q5,B1,P5> but maybe someone only needs fewer hours to refresh their mind and they don't need eight hours
SI137O-00184-P10005 1 SI137O-00184  0.00 17.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is a fairly quiet city where you can go out to party with friends and it is a beautiful city for studies and other things than doing sports
SI137O-00184-P10006 1 SI137O-00184  0.00 13.64 <o,Q4,B2,P1> during the holidays i really like to party go out with my friends to different places and why not different countries

SI137O-00184-P30017 1 SI137O-00184  0.00  5.23 <o,Q4,B2,P3> there are many advantages of working to pay for your studies
SI137O-00184-P30017 1 SI137O-00184  5.23 12.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first of all it allows us to be autonomous and not to have to always ask our parents for help
SI137O-00184-P30017 1 SI137O-00184 12.80 17.23 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it also allows us to meet new people
SI137O-00184-P30017 1 SI137O-00184 17.23 26.78 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however the fact of working takes a lot of time and we can revise much less which can be an inconvenience during our studies
SI137O-00184-P30017 1 SI137O-00184 26.78 54.96 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it is a good thing to work during our studies because i did it last year but we also have to find time to work on our classes and find time for our family for our girlfriend and for our friends because that's very important in university life
SI137O-00184-P40018 1 SI137O-00184  0.00  7.69 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i'm going to present the different stages that people need to go through to travel by airplane
SI137O-00184-P40018 1 SI137O-00184  7.69 12.09 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all we must travel to the airport
SI137O-00184-P40018 1 SI137O-00184 12.09 28.06 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and once we are in the airport we can check in and show our documents to pass security
SI137O-00184-P40018 1 SI137O-00184 28.06 38.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> second we can wait in a restaurant go to the toilet and have a coffee
SI137O-00184-P40018 1 SI137O-00184 38.70 56.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and finally we can board the plane and go to our destination
SI137O-00184-P50019 1 SI137O-00184  0.00 11.47 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think of technology as a great advance for the world because it allows us to do a lot of research and makes our lives a lot easier
SI137O-00184-P50019 1 SI137O-00184 11.47 18.93 <o,Q4,B2,P5> however we have to be careful how much time we spend on technologies
SI137O-00184-P50020 1 SI137O-00184  0.00 14.95 <o,Q4,B2,P5> studying with a teacher face to face is really enriching because he can explain to us directly if we don't understand certain things

SI137O-00184-P50021 1 SI137O-00184  0.00 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that working in a group is a good thing because it allows us to develop more skills like friendship skills and allows us to meet people and make friends
SI137O-00184-P50023 1 SI137O-00184  0.00 19.67 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is very important to develop learning facilities because they allow students to be more autonomous and to find working methods in order to have good results in different tests
SI137O-00231-P10005 1 SI137O-00231  0.00  1.72 <o,Q5,C,P1> i live in shanghai
SI137O-00231-P10005 1 SI137O-00231  1.72 13.09 <o,Q5,C,P1> shanghai is a bustling metropolis which is famous for its futuristic skylines vibrant culture and its prosperous economy
SI137O-00231-P10005 1 SI137O-00231 13.09 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> it is also a city with a long history dating back more than a thousand years
SI137O-00231-P10006 1 SI137O-00231  0.00  3.58 <o,Q5,C,P1> on my holidays i usually go to dance clubs
SI137O-00231-P10006 1 SI137O-00231  3.58 13.70 <o,Q5,C,P1> dancing boosts my muscular strength and flexibility as well as improving my coordination and balance
SI137O-00231-P10006 1 SI137O-00231 13.70 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> also while dancing i improve my confidence
SI137O-00231-P10007 1 SI137O-00231  0.00 14.77 <o,Q5,C,P1> i would like to spend most of my time with my mother because we are both avid readers and we love to share our different opinions about a book or a piece of knowledge inside it
SI137O-00231-P10007 1 SI137O-00231 14.77 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> and she always encourages me to voice my opinion
SI137O-00231-P10008 1 SI137O-00231  0.00 10.46 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i would like to become a diplomat in the future so that i can voice opinions on different issues on behalf of my motherland
SI137O-00231-P10008 1 SI137O-00231 10.46 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> i know it's a demanding job and requires effort but i'll seize any opportunities to improve my abilities
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231  0.00 10.79 <o,Q4,C,P3> there's no getting away from the fact that more and more students are willing to take a part time job while they are studying at universities
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 10.79 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> and this kind of phenomenon does have some advantages
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 15.25 31.40 <o,Q4,C,P3> students seize opportunities to earn incomes and they get a salary for their work which helps their parents save a lot of money and should be encouraged
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 31.40 46.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> but it has some disadvantages like part time jobs may distract students from their normal study process and do some harm to their academic scores
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 46.58 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> so my opinion is that they should balance their work and study in order to develop themselves while having access to the wider society
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231  0.00  5.60 <o,Q4,C,P4> now i'm going to introduce the steps of travelling by airplane
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231  5.60 11.76 <o,Q4,C,P4> first you should take some transportation to the airport
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 11.76 17.86 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can take a bus or drive a car or take the underground
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 17.86 30.10 <o,Q4,C,P4> after you arrive at the airport what you should do next is to check in that is to say to put your luggage on the plane ahead of time
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 30.10 33.29 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you go to document control
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 33.29 40.17 <o,Q4,C,P4> some officials will do some checks in order to ensure security
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 40.17 46.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> finally after you have passed the checks you can enter the waiting room
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 46.94 56.08 <o,Q4,C,P4> during the waiting time you can choose to go shopping or have a coffee or eat something if you're feeling peckish
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 56.08 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P4> finally you can go on board and have a good time
SI137O-00231-P50019 1 SI137O-00231  0.00  4.97 <o,Q4,C,P5> so first technology can offer us a lot of new information

SI137O-00231-P50020 1 SI137O-00231  0.00 10.03 <o,Q4,C,P5> well learning face to face sometimes boosts efficiency and makes me more focused on learning itself

SI137O-00231-P50021 1 SI137O-00231 11.95 20.28 <o,Q4,C,P5> and second students can learn the spirit of cooperation which is very important in society
SI137O-00231-P50022 1 SI137O-00231  0.00 15.85 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think attending lectures is sometimes more effective because when you are listening to others' opinions you are observing subjectively and efficiently to judge whether what they said is true or false
SI137O-00231-P50022 1 SI137O-00231 15.85 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> but when you are reading books you may sometimes just get distracted
SI137O-00236-P10007 1 SI137O-00236  0.00 18.92 <o,Q4,A2,P1> my best ways to improve my skills in english are practising writing and speaking especially by reading a book and watching a movie
SI137O-00236-P10008 1 SI137O-00236  0.00 18.58 <o,Q4,A2,P1> of course i will be happy about it because i can be more effective in communicating with other people and in my work
SI137O-00236-P30017 1 SI137O-00236  0.00 14.09 <o,Q3,B1,P3> in my opinion doing a part time job while they are studying has some advantages and disadvantages
SI137O-00236-P30017 1 SI137O-00236 14.09 32.54 <o,Q3,B1,P3> the advantage is they can be responsible for themselves
SI137O-00236-P30017 1 SI137O-00236 32.54 39.17 <o,Q3,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is it can interfere with their time to study
SI137O-00236-P30017 1 SI137O-00236 39.17 46.82 <o,Q3,B1,P3> i think it can be tried but in a proportion that is not too much

SI137O-00236-P40018 1 SI137O-00236  7.56 20.70 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first pollution from factories and vehicles is emitted and becomes acid particles in smoke
SI137O-00236-P40018 1 SI137O-00236 20.70 28.10 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then these acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00236-P40018 1 SI137O-00236 28.10 39.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and some acid particles fall as dust and some other acid particles mix with cloud water and become rain or snow

SI137O-00244-P10007 1 SI137O-00244  4.80 13.47 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i also take english courses because teachers can correct my errors

SI137O-00244-P10008 1 SI137O-00244  6.56 11.65 <o,Q5,C,P1> i think it's cool to play the guitar while you are singing
SI137O-00244-P10008 1 SI137O-00244 11.65 15.64 <o,Q5,C,P1> and it can warm up the atmosphere too
SI137O-00244-P10008 1 SI137O-00244 15.64 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P1> so i want to learn this new skill
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  8.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> there are advantages if university students do part time jobs
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244  8.62 18.50 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example students can gain skills and work experience and they can earn some pocket money
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 18.50 27.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> if they want to buy things like a cell phone they can pay for it themselves
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 27.78 33.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> and through the work experience they can become independent
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 33.21 37.52 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand they may have no time for their studies
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 37.52 44.92 <o,Q5,C,P3> and their studies can take longer too because they're doing part time jobs
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 44.92 50.64 <o,Q5,C,P3> personally i don't think all university students should do part time jobs

SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 11.46 13.95 <o,Q4,B2,P4> please look at this diagram
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 13.95 18.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first we see pollution comes from factories and vehicles
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 18.80 22.66 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then acid particles are in smoke
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 22.66 27.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> next acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 27.16 30.04 <o,Q4,B2,P4> there are two possibilities here

SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 34.17 37.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 37.59 42.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> after that acid particles are in rain or snow
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 42.05 46.36 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that's how acid rain is formed

SI137O-00244-P50019 1 SI137O-00244  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i would suggest that they should have three regular meals every day and they should eat vegetables and fruit as much as possible so that they can get enough vitamins
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  4.29 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's important to drink a lot of water
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244  4.29 10.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you don't drink enough it's easy to get dehydrated
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244 10.52 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if the body doesn't have enough water you will feel very tired and you have no energy to do anything
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  4.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> basically it's essential to do exercise every day
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244  4.94 12.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we don't need to do very much even twenty minutes would be ok
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244 12.04 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the most important thing is we keep moving and we live well
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  3.73 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it depends on the person
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  3.73  6.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> some people need eight hours
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  6.12  9.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> some people need only five hours
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  9.01 13.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so the most important thing is you sleep enough
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244 13.46 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you sleep enough then you have energy to do anything
SI137O-00244-P50023 1 SI137O-00244  0.00 15.03 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think technology has a negative impact on people's health because we always overuse the computer or smartphone
SI137O-00244-P50023 1 SI137O-00244 15.03 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it can harm our eyes our sight
SI137O-00251-P10005 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  9.12 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm very interested in learning about other countries because it can give me an opportunity to study other traditions and cultures
SI137O-00251-P10005 1 SI137O-00251  9.12 19.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and also i can meet other people that i can communicate with to improve my foreign language skills
SI137O-00251-P10006 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  5.07 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i enjoy spending my free time with my friends in the school stadium
SI137O-00251-P10006 1 SI137O-00251  5.07 19.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we can play all kinds of sports out there such as ping pong racing and basketball which will give us healthier bodies and a fun time
SI137O-00251-P10007 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  8.06 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way for me to improve my english is to read aloud and watch some english movies
SI137O-00251-P10007 1 SI137O-00251  8.06 12.69 <o,Q4,B2,P1> reading aloud will lead me to have good pronunciation

SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  9.46 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it is very common that all university students do part time jobs while they're studying and there are many advantages
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251  9.46 15.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example they can make friends with each other when they are working
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 15.72 23.49 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and they can also learn many practical skills which might be used in the near future
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 23.49 36.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and as for the disadvantages i think they will find it hard to strike a balance between their part time jobs and their studies
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 36.43 43.19 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion i think all university students should do part time jobs
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 43.19 56.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and they can do this to improve their abilities working with each other

SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  1.60 <o,Q4,B2,P4> hello
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251  1.60  5.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i am giving a presentation about acid rain
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251  5.27 11.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> firstly there are many cars and factories that generate some pollution like smoke
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 11.77 15.84 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and acid particles are in the smoke
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 15.84 23.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as the smoke is carried by the wind the acid particles will divide into two parts
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 23.14 30.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some acid particles will fall as dust and damage lakes
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 30.20 38.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and other acid particles will mix with cloud water and then they will be in rain or snow
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 38.80 42.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that would do great damage to the environment

SI137O-00251-P50019 1 SI137O-00251  0.00 13.48 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i suggest they can eat more vegetables and fruits because they contain more nutrients than meat and junk food
SI137O-00251-P50019 1 SI137O-00251 13.48 19.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and this will lead to better health and stronger bodies

SI137O-00251-P50021 1 SI137O-00251 11.20 19.86 <o,Q5,B2,P5> to connect with each other you can do exercise with other people who share the same interest in sport
SI137O-00251-P50022 1 SI137O-00251  0.00 10.76 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that an eight hour sleep at night can give us a clear mind in the daytime

SI137O-00281-P10005 1 SI137O-00281  5.52 13.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that's why i'm interested in getting to know other cultures and other languages
SI137O-00281-P10006 1 SI137O-00281  0.00 17.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i like doing some sport and to walk and talk to my friends and to play with my children
SI137O-00281-P10007 1 SI137O-00281  0.00  7.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> the best way to improve my english is to completely immerse myself in english
SI137O-00281-P10007 1 SI137O-00281  7.96 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to say speak all the time in english listen to the radio or the t v in english and write in english too

SI137O-00281-P30017 1 SI137O-00281 10.15 30.32 <o,Q4,B1,P3> because that way they can have more money more cash and they depend less on their parents
SI137O-00281-P30017 1 SI137O-00281 30.32 50.77 <o,Q4,B1,P3> a disadvantage of working during university is that they will have less free time to enjoy life
SI137O-00281-P30017 1 SI137O-00281 50.77 59.70 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion it's good to have a part time job but not all the time

SI137O-00281-P40018 1 SI137O-00281 46.17 59.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and this water has a lot of acid particles and causes damage to the environment
SI137O-00281-P50019 1 SI137O-00281  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> to have good eating habits it's good to eat several kinds of fruits less meat and more vegetables and less sugar
SI137O-00281-P50020 1 SI137O-00281  0.00  5.92 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it is very important to drink water

SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 31.67 37.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> once we check in we must pass document control and security
SI137O-00286-P40018 1 SI137O-00286 37.34 40.59 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then we have to stay waiting

SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319  0.00  5.52 <o,Q5,B2,P4> today i'm going to introduce several steps for travelling by airplane
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319  5.52 11.61 <o,Q5,B2,P4> first you need to travel to the airport by public transportation or your private car
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 11.61 20.54 <o,Q5,B2,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 20.54 25.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> after that you need to have your documents checked by the staff
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 25.98 32.09 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they will check all the details and your identity
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 32.09 35.24 <o,Q5,B2,P4> following this there is a security check
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 35.24 41.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they might check your personal belongings and your pockets and so on
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 41.00 51.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you are done with all those things you might need to wait at your correct gate and sit or go to the toilet or shop
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 51.77 59.87 <o,Q5,B2,P4> finally you go on board and your flight takes off
SI137O-00319-P50019 1 SI137O-00319  0.00  6.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for university students they might use google scholar to do their literature review
SI137O-00319-P50019 1 SI137O-00319  6.53 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> besides that they might use zoom or teams to ask their professors some questions and also have effective conversations with their classmates
SI137O-00319-P50020 1 SI137O-00319  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is clear for normal students face to face tecahing of course guides them to be disciplined and also to be effective but for the students who are geniuses studying alone is a much better way for them
SI137O-00319-P50021 1 SI137O-00319  0.00  8.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well firstly they will learn how to negotiate and cooperate with other team members
SI137O-00319-P50021 1 SI137O-00319  8.24 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in addition they might study how to manage their personality properly because there are many different views in teams
SI137O-00319-P50023 1 SI137O-00319  0.00 15.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i have to say it is a hundred percent significant for universities to do so because right now artificial intelligence is very modern and popular among students

SI137O-00324-P10005 1 SI137O-00324  0.00  8.64 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i am very interested because i want to travel to other countries and find out about their culture and traditions
SI137O-00324-P10005 1 SI137O-00324  8.64 18.92 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i want to speak with people in this language because it's the most widely spoken language in the world
SI137O-00324-P10006 1 SI137O-00324  0.00 15.49 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i go with my friends and family to concerts museums and maybe go for a swim or go to a coffee shop just to talk and have some fun
SI137O-00324-P10006 1 SI137O-00324 15.49 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but most of the time i'm just in my house
SI137O-00324-P10007 1 SI137O-00324  0.00  8.35 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i watch movies read books and listen to music in english
SI137O-00324-P10007 1 SI137O-00324  8.35 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i visit sites like this like write and improve and speak and improve to improve my english
SI137O-00324-P10008 1 SI137O-00324  0.00 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i would choose to learn better and faster without any problems and to keep any information in my head and share it with others
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324  0.00 16.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages are that the students can learn more about their work but at the same time they can earn or make more money while they are studying
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324 16.30 38.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the disadvantages are that they won't have a lot of time to work and study if they cannot balance their job and studies and so they need some free time to do a lot of other things
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324 38.34 59.70 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion they need to work and organise their time to work and study at the same time without any problems and then they can learn and improve their job and study time
SI137O-00324-P40018 1 SI137O-00324  0.00  4.09 <o,Q5,B1,P4> this is an image of the environment
SI137O-00324-P40018 1 SI137O-00324  4.09 14.74 <o,Q5,B1,P4> as we can see factories and vehicles create pollution that becomes acid particles in the smoke

SI137O-00324-P40018 1 SI137O-00324 26.18 36.15 <o,Q5,B1,P4> other acid particles mix with clouds in winter and those fall in rain and snow
SI137O-00324-P50019 1 SI137O-00324  0.00  6.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think eating habits are important to have a healthy life
SI137O-00324-P50019 1 SI137O-00324  6.53 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that the most important thing is to eat fruit and vegetables that make you feel more comfortable with yourself and your body
SI137O-00324-P50020 1 SI137O-00324  0.00 11.07 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's very important to drink water because you can clean your body and you need to do it every single day
SI137O-00324-P50021 1 SI137O-00324  0.00  7.35 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yes i think doing exercise is very important because it makes your body stronger
SI137O-00324-P50021 1 SI137O-00324  7.35 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you can do any exercise like swimming or football or tennis or any exercise you want but it's very important to do it regularly

SI137O-00324-P50022 1 SI137O-00324  5.30 16.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you need to sleep eight hours per day and if you don't you're going to be weaker
SI137O-00324-P50023 1 SI137O-00324  0.00  4.11 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah i think both are correct
SI137O-00324-P50023 1 SI137O-00324  4.11 11.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> technology brings you information that is very important to have a healthy life
SI137O-00324-P50023 1 SI137O-00324 11.63 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but also you can find fake news that could be dangerous for us

SI137O-00330-P10005 1 SI137O-00330 11.96 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> in my opinion it's really important for our future
SI137O-00330-P10006 1 SI137O-00330  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> learn about circuits and play video games and see some movies at the cinema

SI137O-00388-P10005 1 SI137O-00388  0.00 18.07 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that there are many different reasons for learning about other countries but i think that the main reasons are the language and the culture that you can learn about
SI137O-00388-P10006 1 SI137O-00388  0.00 11.08 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my free time i really enjoy reading textbooks about philosophy and about science like physics
SI137O-00388-P10006 1 SI137O-00388 11.08 18.41 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and also of course i like to hang out with friends
SI137O-00388-P10007 1 SI137O-00388  0.00 18.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say that the best way to improve my english is speaking speaking with friends and with people that can only speak english
SI137O-00388-P10008 1 SI137O-00388  0.00  6.54 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would definitely learn to play an instrument
SI137O-00388-P10008 1 SI137O-00388  6.54 18.41 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i really like the guitar and i would like to perform my favourite songs by pink floyd and other rock groups
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388  0.00  6.32 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i would say that the advantages are very clear
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388  6.32 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that the students that have to work they have more money
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 15.70 22.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in this way they don't have to depend on their parents
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 22.91 35.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage i think is that they have less time to rest and to hang out with friends or something like that
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 35.50 47.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion i would say that each person has to do what they want
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 47.02 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in this case i think that it is possible to do the two things at the same time so i don't see a problem
SI137O-00388-P40018 1 SI137O-00388  0.00 11.74 <o,Q5,B2,P4> the first step in the production of acid rain is the pollution that comes from factories and vehicles

SI137O-00388-P40018 1 SI137O-00388 29.78 39.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> in that situation some acid particles fall as dust contaminating lakes
SI137O-00388-P40018 1 SI137O-00388 39.02 51.68 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and other acid particles mix with clouds and fall in the form of water damaging the trees and the environment
SI137O-00388-P50019 1 SI137O-00388  0.00  6.63 <o,Q5,B2,P5> my advice is that people have to control their diet

SI137O-00388-P50021 1 SI137O-00388  0.00  6.03 <o,Q4,B2,P5> obviously i think that it is not essential to do exercise every day
SI137O-00388-P50021 1 SI137O-00388  6.03 17.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think that it is very important that you do exercise as often as you can
SI137O-00388-P50022 1 SI137O-00388  0.00 19.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i agree with that because sleeping well is essential to be rested during your day and to be at your best at work and with your family
SI137O-00388-P50023 1 SI137O-00388  0.00  9.40 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that technology has neither positive nor negative consequences in our life
SI137O-00388-P50023 1 SI137O-00388  9.40 18.92 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that all these questions depend on each person's use of technology

SI137O-00414-P30017 1 SI137O-00414  7.65 29.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantage is that the student can get some experience in the time that he's studying but the disadvantage from my point of view it's that maybe this person can lose their focus on their studies so this could be complicated

SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 23.99 44.72 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so part of these particles will fall as dust directly in the environment nearby and part of these can be mixed with the cloud water and then that's the way acid rain is formed
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 44.72 54.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this could damage the environment a little bit more than when it's carried just as dust

SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 37.80 48.38 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the situation is this acid rain moves over the world and the atmosphere with the wind for example

SI137O-00594-P50019 1 SI137O-00594  0.00 15.03 <o,Q5,A2,P5> good advice about eating habits is to transform your own life into a more healthy one and consequently life is good
SI137O-00594-P50019 1 SI137O-00594 15.03 19.94 <o,Q5,A2,P5> because good eating habits are essential for human lives

SI137O-00594-P50021 1 SI137O-00594  6.29 11.62 <o,Q5,A2,P5> it's the same as eating and drink water programmatically

SI137O-00594-P50023 1 SI137O-00594  0.00 17.56 <o,Q5,A2,P5> i think technology is a good ally because it helps us to do great things like drinking sleeping and doing exercise for a good healthy lifestyle you know

SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608  0.00  7.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> now i'm going to talk about students doing fitness classes in college

SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 25.21 30.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are obvious too
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 30.98 38.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first some students may not be suitable for these fitness classes because they have a weak body
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 38.75 46.44 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and then they will get hurt in the fitness classes
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 46.44 59.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion i recommend fitness classes in colleges because nowadays the students need to get more and more exercise in their schools
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608  0.00  5.24 <o,Q4,B1,P4> today i'm going to talk about how honey is produced
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608  5.24  9.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all the bees will collect nectar from flowers
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608  9.87 16.28 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then in the beehives the bees make honey from nectar together
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 16.28 23.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when the honey is formed the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 23.92 32.71 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then the beekeepers will pour the honey into bottles
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 32.71 47.79 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then after that there are some vehicles that transport the bottles of honey to the shops
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 47.79 59.36 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally in the shops they will give them a price and put them onto the shelves so we can buy them
SI137O-00608-P50019 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.26 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion they should consider the fees when studying abroad and the economic level because money is the most important thing and the locals' different culture is important too
SI137O-00608-P50020 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think having a good command of a second language will help you have better communication with other people in their countries and when you are in different countries you will speak easily to other people
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 12.82 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion the most difficult thing is the local language because it is not the mother tongue for most students studying abroad
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608 12.82 17.43 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and the second one is the different local culture
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608 17.43 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's very different from ours
SI137O-00608-P50022 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think they can learn about the local culture by reading some books which are about local history and they can also go on the internet and search for some information about the history
SI137O-00608-P50023 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with them because when you study abroad just by yourself you will learn many life skills which can help you become more independent and you will not depend too much on your parents for money and anything else

SI137O-00618-P10007 1 SI137O-00618  0.00  5.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way to learn english is by listening to broadway musicals
SI137O-00618-P10007 1 SI137O-00618  5.79 18.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is important to listen to music but i think broadway musicals can use difficult structures that you can imitate so you could improve

SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 14.32 29.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so for example i think some areas of those advantages are you could communicate better and you have confidence when you give a presentation

SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 53.02 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion it's important to have a balance in your life

SI137O-00618-P50019 1 SI137O-00618  6.58 11.65 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you have to eat meat fish or something that can bring you protein

SI137O-00857-P50022 1 SI137O-00857 13.86 18.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's also a really great place where you can learn about the local culture
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857  0.00  7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's true because it gives you the freedom to do whatever you like
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857  7.41 12.78 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and if you make mistakes there isn't really anybody from your family that could help you
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857 12.78 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it just makes you grow up as a person even if you don't want to
SI137O-00859-P10005 1 SI137O-00859  0.00  3.39 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i am very interested
SI137O-00859-P10006 1 SI137O-00859  0.00 13.63 <o,Q4,A2,P1> i spend my free time reading studying english and spanish and planning to travel around the world

SI137O-00859-P30017 1 SI137O-00859 41.67 48.10 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so i agree and support this option
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859  0.00  6.18 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first factories produce a lot of pollution
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859  6.18 12.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and this causes acid particles to be in smoke
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 12.93 19.51 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and these acid particles are carried by wind
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 19.51 27.38 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the wind makes some particles fall as dust

SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 41.53 47.38 <o,Q4,B1,P4> this process forms acid rain

SI137O-00859-P50019 1 SI137O-00859  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> so i think healthy living is a hard process but i can do this with discipline and share with others that i can do this too
SI137O-00859-P50020 1 SI137O-00859  0.00 11.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> water can help you to think with more clarity and sleep more healthily too

SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 16.74 22.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so they create smoke and these acid particles are inside this smoke

SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904  5.57 25.59 <o,Q5,C,P3> when students do part time jobs they will have enough money they earn enough money for their studies and they can earn enough money you know for things that they can buy and they will also become more responsible

SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 40.77 48.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> first of all the students will not have enough time for their studies and for their leisure time
SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 48.56 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> but personally i think part time jobs are necessary since they prepare students for their life

SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916  6.94  9.73 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it has both pros and cons
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916  9.73 32.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the one hand the advantages could be that the students of schools and colleges get or keep fit because of the fact that some scientific studies say that we must obtain some proteins or nutrients for our brain because our brains are working during the day
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 32.04 42.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and we need these substances to make a good connection between the brain and our body
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 42.06 52.56 <o,Q4,B2,P3> oh and on the other hand the disadvantages could be that the students have less time to study their units
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 52.56 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so to sum up in my opinion it's important to have time for all these types of activities
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916  0.00  5.58 <o,Q5,C,P4> if you want to know how honey comes from flowers and goes to the shop i'm going to explain it
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916  5.58  9.15 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all bees collect nectar from flowers
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916  9.15 12.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> and bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 12.13 21.55 <o,Q5,C,P4> so this type of animal is said to be the most important animal on the planet because without them the planet could die
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 21.55 33.75 <o,Q5,C,P4> secondly the beekeepers collect the honey from beehives in order to put it into a container that is called a jar
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 33.75 50.02 <o,Q5,C,P4> by the end of the process it will be put into a car and a person will transport these types of containers to a supermarket or a shop
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 50.02 59.02 <o,Q5,C,P4> and there people can buy this honey and take this food to their homes
SI137O-00916-P50019 1 SI137O-00916  0.00 14.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if i were them i would choose a country where i could speak the language for example the u s a or london something like that because i could communicate with other people and it's easier for me
SI137O-00916-P50019 1 SI137O-00916 14.61 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and a country where the climate is similar to the country where they come from
SI137O-00916-P50020 1 SI137O-00916  0.00  7.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all the advantage of studying a second language is that you can communicate with other people
SI137O-00916-P50020 1 SI137O-00916  7.88 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you can travel to more countries because you know another language and you can understand what other people say to you
SI137O-00916-P50021 1 SI137O-00916  0.00 14.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the difficulty of studying in another country from my point of view is that you don't have your family near so if you want them near or you need them you can only call them with your mobile phone or something like that

SI137O-00916-P50022 1 SI137O-00916  8.94 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example in order to know this type of culture you could visit monuments or churches or take part in festivities
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916  0.00  7.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because of the fact that you are abroad from my point of view you become more independent because you have to do everything by yourself
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916  7.25 15.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you don't have your family near your friends near so if you want something you have to obtain it alone
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916 15.72 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so this is the reason why you become more independent
SI137O-00922-P10006 1 SI137O-00922  0.00 10.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm inclined to read novels which can allow me step into the fantastic world that the books provide

SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 10.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's argued by many people that all students should get jobs to pay for their university studies themselves
SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931 10.55 28.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> this has several advantages the main one is that they get the experience of working in a workplace and they have extra pocket money and they do not need to ask their parents for money
SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931 28.72 52.19 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but doing jobs in their free time may not leave enough time for their university studies which is why i think it's better for them to get jobs after finishing their degree
SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931  0.00  8.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> people who want to travel by aeroplane need to go through several stages

SI137O-00931-P40018 1 SI137O-00931 14.88 18.89 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then they go to check in

SI137O-00931-P50019 1 SI137O-00931 15.71 19.09 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think technology has a good impact on studying
SI137O-00931-P50020 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i also think that face to face learning is the best way of studying because the students who are studying face to face will be under supervision because not every student is able to study without supervision
SI137O-00931-P50022 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 14.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> no i don't think so because attending lectures has always seemed boring to students so i think reading alone can be a much more effective way of studying
SI137O-00931-P50023 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 17.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's really important for universities to provide their students with modern learning facilities because if they are not up to date it can have a bad impact on their students' productivity

SI137O-00976-P10007 1 SI137O-00976  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i guess it must be speaking coz you know learning a foreign language and stuff the most important part is speaking coz while you are speaking you may make some mistakes and the process of correcting the mistakes is what helps you to improve yourself a lot
SI137O-00976-P10008 1 SI137O-00976  0.00 11.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i suppose it might be to learn how to play the piano coz i already know how to play the violin and i really love music

SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976  4.15 11.44 <o,Q5,C,P3> as we all know doing part time jobs will give us more experience to work in society

SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 18.30 25.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> and that will give them some money and give them more ways to get the money to pay for their living costs
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 25.75 47.89 <o,Q5,C,P3> but there are also some disadvantages coz that might be a very distracting thing and maybe the students can be missing out on their social life while they are doing the part time jobs coz they're still students and they don't have much social life experience
