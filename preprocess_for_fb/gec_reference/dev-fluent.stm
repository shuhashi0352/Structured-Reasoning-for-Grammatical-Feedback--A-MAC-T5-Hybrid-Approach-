SI114J-00011-P30017 1 SI114J-00011  7.22 16.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> students should keep their health and wellness in its best part because they are in the best age of health

SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 18.98 25.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> first bees collect the nectar from flowers
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 25.56 35.74 <o,Q5,C,P4> then they return to the beehives and make the honey using the nectar
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 35.74 43.23 <o,Q5,C,P4> when they are finished beekeepers collect the honey from the beehives
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 43.23 48.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> then those honey are stored in the glasses
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 48.42 55.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> when they are stored they are shipped to the shops and supermarkets
SI114J-00011-P40018 1 SI114J-00011 55.14 58.05 <o,Q5,C,P4> this is the journey of the honey

SI114J-00011-P50019 1 SI114J-00011  0.00 12.45 <o,Q5,C,P5> there's no doubt that choosing a country is essential thing for students in order to decide in which university they want to study
SI114J-00011-P50019 1 SI114J-00011 12.45 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the first they should consider the safety of the country and the education equality
SI114J-00011-P50021 1 SI114J-00011  0.00  8.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> there is no doubt that the students who want study abroad would face many difficulties

SI114J-00045-P30017 1 SI114J-00045 37.78 54.21 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and at the same time the disadvantage of these classes could be that you are using time that could be used as a study time or learning some other things

SI114J-00045-P50020 1 SI114J-00045 11.76 19.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and at the same time it is a very valuable thing that enterprises value
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045  0.00  6.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that there are a lot of constraints when you're studying in another country
SI114J-00045-P50021 1 SI114J-00045  6.79 16.79 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all you have to learn a new language and talk in a new language or in your second language

SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045  0.00 11.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion studying abroad definitely helps you to be more independent because you have to do everything at your own
SI114J-00045-P50023 1 SI114J-00045 11.12 19.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you have to go to the bank you have to do the laundry and all those things you don't do when you live alone

SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057  0.00  9.89 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion is a good idea that students in get a job to pay their studies
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057  9.89 22.61 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but you had to haved of a job of the half time because you have to get a balance between your students and your job
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 22.61 43.05 <o,Q3,B2,P3> one of the advantage is that you can get experience because a lot of students get graduate but they have not idea about how is the laboral world
SI114J-00057-P30017 1 SI114J-00057 43.05 52.53 <o,Q3,B2,P3> in my opinion is one of the best thing that one student can do when they are studying yet

SI114J-00057-P50019 1 SI114J-00057  8.30 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> one of them is that we can look for all the information using internet as we can look for examples in videos
SI114J-00057-P50020 1 SI114J-00057  0.00 12.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> face to face is the best way to learn because you can look your professor and you can concentrate best
SI114J-00057-P50020 1 SI114J-00057 12.71 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in this way you have not distractors

SI114J-00057-P50022 1 SI114J-00057  8.89 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> instead when you are attending lectures with other people you cannot do that

SI114J-00206-P10008 1 SI114J-00206  7.42 12.95 <o,Q4,B1,P1> is one of my favorite jobs now
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206  0.00 15.50 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i think that one advantage is that while you are working you are learning what is the life and the same time you are studying of course
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 15.50 28.71 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that maybe you are too much busy working and studying at the same time than you can turn a little stressed
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 28.71 35.86 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and this isn't a good thing for the healthy
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 35.86 43.56 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and in my opinion i think that is a good idea do the both things at the same time working and studying
SI114J-00206-P30017 1 SI114J-00206 43.56 57.14 <o,Q4,B1,P3> because working you can learn a lot of things that you can't learn studying and studying you can learn things that you can't learn while working

SI114J-00206-P40018 1 SI114J-00206 13.49 18.05 <o,Q4,A2,P4> then when you are here you must check in

SI114J-00224-P30017 1 SI114J-00224 32.38 46.30 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a part time job give more independence and allows to be in contact with real job

SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233  9.41 19.65 <o,Q5,B2,P3> some of the advantages of having a part time job while studying is that the students gain the responsibility of their actions
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 19.65 32.66 <o,Q5,B2,P3> also they gain the skill of organising more their time and also the skill of working in teams and cooperate with each other
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 32.66 45.92 <o,Q5,B2,P3> a disadvantage is that they have not much time to study so an effect is that the grades decline and they can sleep in class
SI114J-00233-P30017 1 SI114J-00233 45.92 59.87 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but in my own opinion i think it's a good way of the students to learn teamwork and organise skills in their life

SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 42.27 49.27 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and these particles are the ones that damage the environment
SI114J-00233-P40018 1 SI114J-00233 49.27 59.87 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so that is why we need to change the factors vehicles and the factories to decline acid rain

SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243  6.20 15.30 <o,Q5,C,P4> so it basically starts by vehicles and factories releasing emissions into the environment
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 15.30 18.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it all comes in smoke
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 18.12 32.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and acid particles that are in this smoke are being carried by the wind and are releasing into the clouds or just fall as dust on the ground
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 32.84 49.69 <o,Q5,C,P4> these particles that are mixed with the cloud they settles to the ground and forests with rain and snow
SI114J-00243-P40018 1 SI114J-00243 49.69 59.98 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this forests are suffering from acid rain
SI114J-00243-P50019 1 SI114J-00243  0.00 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> i would recommend these people to listen to what their gut feelings tell them because they would know what food they really want and not their brain but their body wants to eat

SI114J-00243-P50022 1 SI114J-00243  0.00 17.63 <o,Q5,C,P5> i agree with the opinion that sleeping around eight hours a day is a key habit because if you don't sleep enough you would be tired and won't be productive at all
SI114J-00243-P50023 1 SI114J-00243  0.00 16.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's quite a questionable opinion because technologies truly help people to make their lives easier but not always

SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 10.16 32.94 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think that one of the advantages that they have if they are studying and they working too is that they were earn money to spend it in their free time
SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 32.94 47.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but maybe the disadvantage is that they don't have enough time to study for example during a week that they have an exam
SI114J-00358-P30017 1 SI114J-00358 47.06 59.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion is very important to work in a file of your own study to earn experience and practise

SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 21.76 28.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then this acid particles that are carried by wind can do two things
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 28.34 34.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> it can be mixed with cloud water or fall as dust
SI114J-00358-P40018 1 SI114J-00358 34.80 54.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> if they mix with cloud water then when the cloud collide fall with the rain or the snow causing damage to the environment and causing damage to the people that are in the ground
SI114J-00358-P50019 1 SI114J-00358  0.00  7.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that it's very important to have habits in your eating

SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622  0.00  1.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> good afternoon
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622  1.85  8.12 <o,Q5,C,P4> i am going to talk about the process of how honey is produced
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622  8.12 12.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 12.42 18.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> to start we can see in the first circle a bee and flowers
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 18.31 22.42 <o,Q5,C,P4> it represents that bees collect nectar from flowers
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 22.42 28.61 <o,Q5,C,P4> after they collect that nectar the bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 28.61 32.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after that beekeepers collect honey from hims
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 32.88 40.39 <o,Q5,C,P4> beekeepers are the people who is in charge to recollect the honey from the beehives
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 40.39 50.38 <o,Q5,C,P4> and also they are in charge in put the honey into different kind of jars it could be in a glass bottle or in a plastic bottle
SI114J-00622-P40018 1 SI114J-00622 50.38 56.97 <o,Q5,C,P4> and after that it can be transport to the supermarket where you are able to acquire it
SI114J-00622-P50019 1 SI114J-00622  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think they have to consider about the documentation they need like passport or visa or other documents their language they speak their customs their traditions their religion and of course the region where it is
SI114J-00622-P50020 1 SI114J-00622  0.00 15.60 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think the first advantage you have if you are able to study in a second language is that you will have the opportunity to true get a better job and of course make yourself understood in that language
SI114J-00622-P50020 1 SI114J-00622 15.60 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> the second language speaken the most is english

SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644  0.00  4.49 <o,Q4,C,P1> in the future i would love to be a university professor
SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644  4.49 14.68 <o,Q4,C,P1> i would like to teach in the area of education possibly regarding inclusion or didactics
SI114J-00644-P10008 1 SI114J-00644 14.68 20.46 <o,Q4,C,P1> that would be my favorite job my ideal job
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644  0.00 18.99 <o,Q5,C,P3> some advantages of students getting jobs to pay for their university studies would be that once they graduate they would already have some experience and perhaps even some idea of what field they want to go into
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 18.99 22.10 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there are some huge disadvantages
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 22.10 32.19 <o,Q5,C,P3> for instance students might not have enough time to focus on their university studies if they have to be working instead
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 32.19 46.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> drop out rates might increase a lot because what would be the point of studying if you already have a job that is paying quite well certainly well enough to finance a college education
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 46.00 51.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion students should not get jobs to pay for university studies
SI114J-00644-P30017 1 SI114J-00644 51.87 60.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> students should get scholarships or some other alternatives to funding

SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 11.72 15.70 <o,Q4,C,P4> the very first thing you need to do is travel to the airport
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 15.70 23.28 <o,Q4,C,P4> you can do this by different means of transport such as car or bus or even the subway depending on your available options
SI114J-00644-P40018 1 SI114J-00644 23.28 28.14 <o,Q4,C,P4> once you've arrived to the airport the first thing you need to do is go to check in

SI114J-00644-P50019 1 SI114J-00644  5.12 19.77 <o,Q4,C,P5> for instance you can take notes faster you can record and later listen calmly or you can even use the internet to find more information about any topic you want to learn more about
SI114J-00644-P50020 1 SI114J-00644  0.00 16.21 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think learning with a teacher face to face can be useful for lower levels learning or young learners people who might have some trouble identifying gaps in their knowledge or self regulating their own learning

SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  3.62 <o,Q5,C,P1> i'm really interested in learning about other countries
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657  3.62  6.42 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example i really love england
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657  6.42 11.83 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have been there several times and i always try to learn anything new when i go there
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 11.83 17.31 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example i have readen different books i have taken different classes on its culture
SI114J-00657-P10005 1 SI114J-00657 17.31 19.09 <o,Q5,C,P1> and i think it's really interesting
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  2.18 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i do different things
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657  2.18  5.96 <o,Q5,C,P1> for example lately i have taken up into cooking
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657  5.96 11.01 <o,Q5,C,P1> i have been developing my cooking skills and i have learn about different recipes
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 11.01 17.03 <o,Q5,C,P1> but for example i also love listening to music doing sport and of course hanging out with friends
SI114J-00657-P10006 1 SI114J-00657 17.03 19.60 <o,Q5,C,P1> so that's more or less my free time
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  8.46 <o,Q5,C,P1> well for me the best way for improving your english is taking part into a community of english learning people
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657  8.46 12.60 <o,Q5,C,P1> and furthermore also in a community of english speaking people
SI114J-00657-P10007 1 SI114J-00657 12.60 18.41 <o,Q5,C,P1> so like that you can be in contact with them and you will learn a lot by communicating with other people
SI114J-00657-P10008 1 SI114J-00657  0.00 17.88 <o,Q5,C,P1> well i would really love to learn how to code because i have always loved technology and computers and i have been so amazed by those programmers which can only by reading sentences they can code a new app or a new video game

SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  6.02 <o,Q5,C,P3> well i think that taking a job while you're studying is a really good experience
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657  6.02 14.18 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example some of the advantages will be that you will be able to learn new things which will be useful for your learning experience
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 14.18 24.73 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you will learn how to manage yourself how to develop other skills such as time management and how to organise yourself and who's to be responsible for your own acts
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 24.73 27.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> however there also will have other disadvantages
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 27.56 31.74 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example you wouldn't have less time to focus on your studies
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 31.74 36.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> and so i think it's really important to be able to know what you can do with your time
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 36.82 50.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example if you know that you are going to need a lot of time for studying you shouldn't take a job because it will take you a lot of time and it will not make possible for you to focus on your job or your learning of the university
SI114J-00657-P30017 1 SI114J-00657 50.53 56.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> so even if it's a really good experience i think that you should be really sure about what you will do
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  5.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> acid rain generates from vehicles and for factories
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657  5.11 10.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> so when they create pollution that pollution get up to the atmosphere
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 10.13 18.95 <o,Q5,C,P4> there the acid particles are carried by the wind and end up mixed with other particles of water which would create a cloud
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 18.95 23.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> that cloud would end up raining over the environment
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 23.67 25.73 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it will have a lot of effects
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 25.73 33.91 <o,Q5,C,P4> so for example it will cause deforestation it will cause that animals will die and it will cause a lot of environmental problems
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 33.91 40.96 <o,Q5,C,P4> for example it could make that the terrain is not good for being able to grow things there
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 40.96 49.62 <o,Q5,C,P4> so you will all not have only a damage to the environment but also to ourself because we have to remember that we are living of than environment
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 49.62 55.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> so the effects that we have on them it will end up affecting also us
SI114J-00657-P40018 1 SI114J-00657 55.77 56.97 <o,Q5,C,P4> so yeah
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  5.06 <o,Q5,C,P5> well the bettest advice by that i can give them is to keep track of what you're eating
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657  5.06 10.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> so for example they can take a piece of paper and write down every day everything they take
SI114J-00657-P50019 1 SI114J-00657 10.86 17.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> so like that at the end of the week they can compare days and they will be able to see ok in which moments i ate bad

SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  2.75 <o,Q5,C,P5> well for me it's really important to drink water
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657  2.75  8.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> we have to remember that we are mainly made up of water so we really should focus on that
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657  8.93 14.79 <o,Q5,C,P5> if we don't take enough water we could have some effects as severe as depression or anxiety
SI114J-00657-P50020 1 SI114J-00657 14.79 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> so by drinking a lot of water we are helping ourselves to be better
SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  5.07 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think that even if it's just for a bit we should every day do exercise

SI114J-00657-P50021 1 SI114J-00657  9.17 15.95 <o,Q5,C,P5> we can also do another type of of exercise for example like climbing or moving walking to the job

SI114J-00657-P50022 1 SI114J-00657  0.00  2.23 <o,Q5,C,P5> well i think it really depends on people

SI114J-00754-P40018 1 SI114J-00754 44.23 54.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then the jarred honey is transported to shops or stores for final delivery to consumers

SI114J-00754-P50019 1 SI114J-00754  6.61 18.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> first of all he or she needs to understand that the educational standard in that country is very high
SI114J-00754-P50020 1 SI114J-00754  0.00 11.36 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the obvious advantage is that student learns different language and he understands how to communicate in that language better
SI114J-00754-P50020 1 SI114J-00754 11.36 18.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and besides he or she can learn about a different culture
SI114J-00754-P50021 1 SI114J-00754  0.00  5.62 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the major drawback will be coping with the culture of the country
SI114J-00754-P50021 1 SI114J-00754  5.62 17.90 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and secondly they might not get help as soon as possible because they will have no relatives in the country
SI114J-00754-P50022 1 SI114J-00754  0.00 13.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> while studying abroad students can learn about the local culture by watching movies at a theater or by going to a concert with friends
SI114J-00754-P50022 1 SI114J-00754 13.14 18.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they also can learn about the local culture by visiting museums

SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336  7.41 20.41 <o,Q4,B2,P3> IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 20.41 42.15 <o,Q4,B2,P3> some disadvantages of doing that is that they have less time for themselves and it's a really hard life to have because the time isn't enough
SI1267-00336-P30017 1 SI1267-00336 42.15 57.14 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my own opinion i think that this is a good way to start in the business area
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336  0.00  9.77 <o,Q5,B1,P4> okay first the industries make pollution and the acid particulars travel with the smoke
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336  9.77 17.49 <o,Q5,B1,P4> then the acid particulars are carried by the wind and some of this fall as dust
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 17.49 38.06 <o,Q5,B1,P4> other of the particulars mix with the cloud and when it rain or snow these fill like acid particles in the environment
SI1267-00336-P40018 1 SI1267-00336 38.06 51.34 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and this could be very critical to all people
SI1267-00336-P50020 1 SI1267-00336  0.00 11.80 <o,Q5,B1,P5> drinking water is really important for people because this way you can stay healthy and you can refresh your brain
SI1267-00336-P50020 1 SI1267-00336 11.80 18.92 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and apart of that this make you functional
SI1267-00336-P50021 1 SI1267-00336  0.00  8.50 <o,Q5,B1,P5> yeah doing exercise every day is really important because this way you can stay stable
SI1267-00336-P50021 1 SI1267-00336  8.50 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this mixed with some good eating habits you will be fit and reduce some grace
SI1267-00336-P50022 1 SI1267-00336  0.00 19.26 <o,Q4,B1,P5> yeah sleeping at least eight hours it's good because this way your body can rest during this hours
SI1267-00336-P50023 1 SI1267-00336  0.00 19.09 <o,Q5,B1,P5> well actually technology has a positive point in the life of the people because people staying in house could start doing some exercise
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 11.50 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm very keen on learning about other cultures because for me it is interesting to see how other people from different parts of the world live and the way they live is very interesting for me
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376 11.50 16.45 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and i can find out more interesting and useful things to learn for example
SI1267-00376-P10005 1 SI1267-00376 16.45 18.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's very interesting for me
SI1267-00376-P10006 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  9.68 <o,Q5,B2,P1> in my free time i enjoy going for a run in the forest or in the park where i can get fresh air and meet interesting animals or plants
SI1267-00376-P10006 1 SI1267-00376  9.68 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i also play tennis with my best friends in the sports hall and another thing i travel a lot in my spare time
SI1267-00376-P10007 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 18.58 <o,Q5,B2,P1> best way to improve my english is to go abroad where i can meet a lot of native speakers and they can help me improve my english and at the same way i can get a lot of information from the culture where the language is spoken and the way people live in their country
SI1267-00376-P10008 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  9.95 <o,Q5,B2,P1> if i want to improve my skills i will choose communication skills because it's very important nowadays to communicate effectively
SI1267-00376-P10008 1 SI1267-00376  9.95 18.41 <o,Q5,B2,P1> for example if you have a problem you need to explain it properly to people to make them understand your problem
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  8.45 <o,Q5,C,P3> it is very important to do part time jobs while you are studying if you don't have enough time of course
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376  8.45 19.36 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the advantage of this is that you can get a lot of experience at work and see how it works with working in teams for example
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 19.36 33.69 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you can also achieve goals in many areas such as sharing ideas with others and get a feedback from experienced workers
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 33.69 44.04 <o,Q5,C,P3> and the disadvantage of this is that you have got a lot of tasks for university studies and for this you need a lot of time
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 44.04 48.31 <o,Q5,C,P3> so in this situation part time jobs wouldn't be suitable
SI1267-00376-P30017 1 SI1267-00376 48.31 55.09 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in my opinion many students should try it because it is very useful
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 17.43 <o,Q5,C,P4> well first of all factories produce products and while they are producing them they also produce dangerous elements which go up to the air and it causes a lot of pollution
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 17.43 21.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then the next step is that acid particles are in smoke
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 21.68 29.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the next stage is acid particles are carried by wind and then wind carry them in the air to other places
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 29.84 35.85 <o,Q5,C,P4> and their fourth stage is that some acid particles fall as dust
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 35.85 39.14 <o,Q5,C,P4> five other acid particles mix with cloud water
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 39.14 42.77 <o,Q5,C,P4> the next step is acid articles are in the rain or snow
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 42.77 48.22 <o,Q5,C,P4> and the other problems with pollution are caused by vehicles
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 48.22 53.24 <o,Q5,C,P4> many transport are used by many factories and other companies
SI1267-00376-P40018 1 SI1267-00376 53.24 57.65 <o,Q5,C,P4> and then we should reduce the transport
SI1267-00376-P50019 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  8.16 <o,Q5,C,P5> well first of all they should eat more fruit and vegetables as they contain a lot of vitamins which can improve their health
SI1267-00376-P50019 1 SI1267-00376  8.16 17.73 <o,Q5,C,P5> and in the morning people can have cereals as breakfast and they should drink a lot of juice as well
SI1267-00376-P50020 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  8.27 <o,Q5,C,P5> it's very important to drink lots of water because our body needs it to stay alive and to be more active
SI1267-00376-P50020 1 SI1267-00376  8.27 16.70 <o,Q5,C,P5> by this i need a lot of water and we should drink it as it's life

SI1267-00376-P50022 1 SI1267-00376  0.00  9.02 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that everyone needs at least eight hours a day sleep because our brain needs the rest after busy days

SI1267-00376-P50023 1 SI1267-00376  0.00 14.76 <o,Q4,C,P5> generally speaking in my opinion technology has a positive impact on our life because nowadays we can easily get information from the internet for example or from other resources as well
SI1267-00376-P50023 1 SI1267-00376 14.76 17.90 <o,Q4,C,P5> and we can save our lives

SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 17.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think the advantage would be that the students could earn their own money and so they could be buy anything that they need
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401 17.86 40.28 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and the disadvantage could be that they can't study and maybe they get stressed because they are working and studying at the same time
SI1267-00401-P30017 1 SI1267-00401 40.28 58.68 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well in my opinion the students they could be working and studying at the same time because you can get money
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 10.12 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well first of all you have to get any way of transport for example get on the bus
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 10.12 19.34 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then it will take you at the airport and you have to check in
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 19.34 42.47 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then it will be document control and the security maybe stopped you for find out about you and some like this
SI1267-00401-P40018 1 SI1267-00401 42.47 54.16 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you have to wait for a moment and then the plane would be board

SI1267-00401-P50019 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think the students use the internet because on internet there is all and they can investigate about any topic and they can learn about all
SI1267-00401-P50020 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yeah i think so because have a teacher with you is the better way to learn any topic because you have a teacher who help you about any question that you have
SI1267-00401-P50021 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think they could do your homeworks faster yeah and making friends and get along well
SI1267-00401-P50023 1 SI1267-00401  0.00 17.96 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's very important because the university should have the better learning facilities of materials because university is the most level school

SI1267-00444-P40018 1 SI1267-00444  9.60 20.75 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we can see in this picture we have a lot of factories and vehicles that produce pollution

SI1267-00508-P10006 1 SI1267-00508  5.51 14.10 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think i spend quite a lot watching t v serial like my favourite t v serial is big bang theory
SI1267-00508-P10007 1 SI1267-00508  0.00  8.71 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think the best way is speaking with my sister and with other persons so i can improve my pronunciation

SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508  0.00 18.12 <o,Q5,C,P3> i think students should do part time jobs because some advantages are that you can create new skills you can have more experience and also you can create new relationships for your work and maybe for your personal life
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 18.12 35.15 <o,Q5,C,P3> and some disadvantages are that maybe like a student you don't have a lot of time and if you have a job and also you need to study it's gonna be difficult and for that you can forget about other relationship like your parents and something like that
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 35.15 49.00 <o,Q5,C,P3> and i think it's the worst idea to lose those relationships because you focus only in your job and in studying
SI1267-00508-P30017 1 SI1267-00508 49.00 54.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i think it's the best way to have experience in the real work

SI1267-00508-P40018 1 SI1267-00508 31.66 36.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that create acids particles that mix with cloud water

SI1267-00518-P50020 1 SI1267-00518 12.82 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think by the way it's good to control but it's bad because you have to work more

SI1267-00518-P50022 1 SI1267-00518  9.68 18.64 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but i think it's better to do it face to face because you can see others' ideas more clearly

SI1267-00518-P50023 1 SI1267-00518 10.82 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so i think it's really good to have other points of view to share your ideas and maybe you'd be better in other areas
SI1267-00521-P10005 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  4.42 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm very interesting in learning about other countries and other cultures
SI1267-00521-P10005 1 SI1267-00521  4.42 11.07 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it's always interesting to know culture so different from your own

SI1267-00521-P10007 1 SI1267-00521  0.00 11.61 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well in my opinion the best way to improve my english is practicing speaking or practicing watching series or playing games in english or reading a book in english
SI1267-00521-P10007 1 SI1267-00521 11.61 15.17 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so practice is the best way to improve my english in my opinion

SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521  7.38 21.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion one advantages will be that working at the same time that studying gives you a sense of responsibility about your life because you have to provide yourself for yourself
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 21.57 36.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but on the other hand i think that working at the same time that you are studying could be affect negatively your academic life because maybe you're tired after working to start to studying properly
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 36.35 38.58 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it will affect your grades
SI1267-00521-P30017 1 SI1267-00521 38.58 50.83 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion there are some advantages to work while you're studying but maybe the disadvantages are worse
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  3.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i'm going to give a little talk about acid rain
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521  3.55 12.78 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain forms firstly when the pollution emitted from the factories goes into the air in the form of particles that are in the smoke
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 12.78 15.86 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then those particles are carried by the wind
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 15.86 22.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some of those particle fall as dust polluting lakes and our forest
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 22.02 28.41 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the rest of those particles mix with the cloud water and then forms clouds
SI1267-00521-P40018 1 SI1267-00521 28.41 45.37 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when those clouds rain or snow the acid particles goes into the soil polluting our trees and our forest and our lakes
SI1267-00521-P50019 1 SI1267-00521  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think that the advice i will give to people who want to improve their eating habits will be do not skip any meal and try to replace as much meat as you can with vegetables to try to reduce the meat you eat
SI1267-00521-P50020 1 SI1267-00521  0.00  3.98 <o,Q5,B2,P5> oh i think it's very important to drink a lot of water
SI1267-00521-P50020 1 SI1267-00521  3.98  7.95 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you should try to eat at least two liters of water per day

SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521  6.89  9.59 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there's no need to do some heavy exercise
SI1267-00521-P50021 1 SI1267-00521  9.59 14.85 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you could also just go for a walk or trying some light exercise

SI1267-00521-P50022 1 SI1267-00521  4.79 14.33 <o,Q5,B2,P5> problem is that you can't always get them because you maybe have to rise early in the morning to go to work or study

SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753  0.00  5.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well students need to consider a lot of things to choose a country
SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753  5.45 17.44 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example they may consider whether they like the food in those countries whether the weather is great and so on
SI1267-00753-P50019 1 SI1267-00753 17.44 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> there is a lot to consider
SI1267-00753-P50021 1 SI1267-00753  0.00 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think foreign students may find it difficult to make friends or fit in with local students because they grew up in two different cultures and the cultural difference can prevent them from being together
SI1267-00753-P50022 1 SI1267-00753  0.00 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i think foreign students can ask local students to share something about their unique culture because those local students have lived in this country for many years and they definitely have a deeper understanding about their culture
SI1267-00753-P50023 1 SI1267-00753  0.00 13.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well studying abroad can definitely help a student become independence because in a foreign country there is no relatives and you need to solve all the questions on your own
SI1267-00753-P50023 1 SI1267-00753 13.82 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's really challenging but it can also benefit you a lot
SI1267-00797-P10006 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  6.89 <o,Q5,B1,P1> when i am on holidays i enjoy relaxing of course
SI1267-00797-P10006 1 SI1267-00797  6.89 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i enjoy swimming to the beach or to the swimming pool for example or going out and visiting the city where i am
SI1267-00797-P10007 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  9.43 <o,Q5,B1,P1> normally i enjoy spending time with my brother because we have similar interests
SI1267-00797-P10007 1 SI1267-00797  9.43 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so every day we play together with video games
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  6.49 <o,Q5,B1,P1> i would like to job as a occupational therapist
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797  6.49  9.63 <o,Q5,B1,P1> actually i am studying for that
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797  9.63 14.83 <o,Q5,B1,P1> but i would like to job as a physiotherapist too
SI1267-00797-P10008 1 SI1267-00797 14.83 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> it's one of my dream so i would like to get
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797  0.00 17.53 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion i think that it's normal that students get jobs to pay their university studies because actually university studies are very expensive
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 17.53 30.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> the advantage is that you will earn money easily because you are working
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 30.48 44.11 <o,Q5,C,P3> the disadvantage is that you haven't got a lot of time to prepare your subjects in the university
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 44.11 49.36 <o,Q5,C,P3> so you have less time than other
SI1267-00797-P30017 1 SI1267-00797 49.36 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> in my opinion i think that it's normal because university studies are very expensive but it's very hard to do this
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  8.33 <o,Q5,B2,P4> firstly you need to travel to airport and go to do the check in

SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 28.46 36.79 <o,Q5,B2,P4> when you are waiting you can drink or eat or go to the toilets
SI1267-00797-P40018 1 SI1267-00797 36.79 52.02 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and when called you to board at the plane you will take off and go when you want to go
SI1267-00797-P50020 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  8.99 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that it's a good option to understand all doubts that you have
SI1267-00797-P50020 1 SI1267-00797  8.99 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if you don't understand anything in relation with the unit that you are studying a teacher could help you
SI1267-00797-P50022 1 SI1267-00797  0.00  8.54 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that attending lectures it's a good option to understand things that you don't know
SI1267-00797-P50022 1 SI1267-00797  8.54 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example if you don't understand what the teacher has said attending lecture will help you for that
SI1267-00797-P50023 1 SI1267-00797  0.00 19.60 <o,Q5,B2,P5> universities want to improve these modern learning facilities because thank of that the students could understand more easily all the information
SI1267-00809-P10005 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  4.49 <o,Q5,B2,P1> my favourite time of the year is absolutely christmas

SI1267-00809-P10006 1 SI1267-00809  0.00 10.82 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i think it's really important to read news like the local ones newspapers but also in the web on internet

SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  8.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> i completely agree with the fact that all university courses should include a period of practical work experience
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809  8.41 32.10 <o,Q4,C,P3> indeed i think that the main advantage of include a period of practical work experience consider the fact that probably after this practical work experience students can find a job and also improve their practical ability
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 32.10 49.24 <o,Q4,C,P3> i think well the main disadvantage of this factor is the fact that probably peoples will think that it's like a waste of time and because they can study while they were working
SI1267-00809-P30017 1 SI1267-00809 49.24 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> well in my opinion i would like to include a period of practical work during my studies
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809  0.00 13.39 <o,Q5,C,P4> these graph shows the number of people visiting these three different sites tunes net music now songs for you during their first week online
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809 13.39 32.31 <o,Q5,C,P4> we can see that in the vertical axis there are the percentage of thousand of people and the days of the week are shown in the horizontal one
SI1267-00809-P40018 1 SI1267-00809 32.31 57.48 <o,Q5,C,P4> we can see that from the fifth day to the seven days tunes net had a climb and there is a drop for example in for the songs for you a slightly drop for music now
SI1267-00809-P50019 1 SI1267-00809  0.00 14.36 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the main characteristic of a team leaders are ambitious also collaboration and enthusiasm
SI1267-00809-P50019 1 SI1267-00809 14.36 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that these three are the most important characteristic of team leaders
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  4.15 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think there is only one problem with a small team
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809  4.15 17.30 <o,Q5,C,P5> well the fact that if a group are small probably there were only few ideas
SI1267-00809-P50020 1 SI1267-00809 17.30 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and this is a disadvantage
SI1267-00809-P50021 1 SI1267-00809  0.00  3.96 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the most important things is the collaboration

SI1267-00809-P50022 1 SI1267-00809 13.27 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that face to face team could create more collaboration

SI1267-00826-P50022 1 SI1267-00826  4.56 15.18 <o,Q4,C,P5> for example for me it's more effective read alone because i don't distract with other things
SI1267-00826-P50022 1 SI1267-00826 15.18 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> but for other students it's more effective read in groups

SI1267-01003-P50020 1 SI1267-01003  0.00 16.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well in my opinion it is very important because our body is made up of water in the seventeen percent so that is why all doctors recommend to drink almost two liters of water a day
SI1267-01003-P50021 1 SI1267-01003  0.00 15.68 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well some recommendations in my point of view doing exercises every day it's an option but you can also do twice or three times a week
SI1267-01003-P50022 1 SI1267-01003  0.00  9.32 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is very important the time of sleeping because there is when we recharge our batteries or our energies
SI1267-01003-P50022 1 SI1267-01003  9.32 15.00 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is very recommended by doctors to sleep almost eight hours

SI1267-01027-P10008 1 SI1267-01027 11.31 15.73 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's a lot of math and it's just really hard
SI1267-01027-P10008 1 SI1267-01027 15.73 19.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i'm still thinking about it
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027  0.00 13.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> if there are many jobs that are available this is really great opportunity for all the students to get jobs to pay their university studies
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 13.29 20.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but some students do also have parents who pay for their university studies which is not as good
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 20.88 33.43 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage is as i mentioned before if you are working while you're studying at the same time it can affect your grade in a bad way
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 33.43 46.80 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in my opinion it's good to get job to pay for your university studies so that you don't have to borrow or lend money from your parents or the bank
SI1267-01027-P30017 1 SI1267-01027 46.80 58.68 <o,Q4,B2,P3> yeah not good to lend money but it's not good either if you're failing your tests
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027  0.00  7.55 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so before you travelling by airplane of course you have to travel to the airport first
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027  7.55 11.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so you can choose between car bus or train
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 11.30 25.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i recommend taking bus or train because if you're driving with car to the airport you have to pay for the parking so obviously it's not worth if you're paying for a ticket
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 25.77 35.30 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you arrive at the airport you have to check in and they will go through document control and security and your baggage
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 35.30 44.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you can just wait at the airport perhaps go to the toilet eat some food and buy some gifts
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 44.20 48.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and when your plane has arrived it's time to board
SI1267-01027-P40018 1 SI1267-01027 48.33 58.68 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then you just wait for your airplane to start flying up to the sky
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027  0.00  4.38 <o,Q4,C,P5> you can go on to websites to find feedback
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027  4.38 12.40 <o,Q4,C,P5> technology you can write on computers which is much easier than to write on paper
SI1267-01027-P50019 1 SI1267-01027 12.40 19.60 <o,Q4,C,P5> but i recommend writing on paper because you will remember the text a lot better
SI1267-01027-P50020 1 SI1267-01027  0.00  2.86 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think exactly the same
SI1267-01027-P50020 1 SI1267-01027  2.86  7.17 <o,Q4,C,P5> during this pandemic we have been having online classes the whole time

SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 20.34 33.96 <o,Q5,B2,P4> secondly is very important to do the check in once you get to the airport before you pass several controls such as document control or security control

SI1267-01188-P40018 1 SI1267-01188 55.12 59.98 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so i would say those are the main steps
SI1267-01188-P50019 1 SI1267-01188  0.00 17.17 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think students can use technology for using other platforms or other options rather than books to study and being connected with people to share knowledge and notes

SI127E-00568-P50023 1 SI127E-00568  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> in my opinion this is really really important for public schools and university because if they don't have resources government should provide them
SI127E-00611-P10005 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  5.32 <o,Q4,B2,P1> personally i'm very interested in environment because there's no planet b
SI127E-00611-P10005 1 SI127E-00611  5.32 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so we have to take care a lot of this because in the future our sons are going to live in the earth and we have to keep it the better we can together
SI127E-00611-P10006 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i met most of my friends in the travel agency where i used to work so the thing that we really enjoy the most is travelling all together especially to mexico because we love the beaches over there and all the food and the traditions
SI127E-00611-P10007 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 10.52 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i would say that i'm very close to my mum because she's the one who spends more time with me and we are also creating a business together
SI127E-00611-P10007 1 SI127E-00611 10.52 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so we do really enjoy doing the same things as for example producings this hand made jewellery brand
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  7.59 <o,Q4,B2,P1> two years ago i had the opportunity to study abroad in the u s and there i discovered miami
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611  7.59 16.09 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would say that miami it's my kind of place where always there's good weather and many plans to do
SI127E-00611-P10008 1 SI127E-00611 16.09 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so definitely i would love to live there in the future
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 21.64 <o,Q4,B2,P3> when talking about introducing fitness classes at schools i would say that there are more advantages than disadvantages for it because it is undeniable that getting to do exercises at least thirty minutes a day it helps to be in a better shape and to be healthier in the future
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 21.64 27.57 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i would say that these are the main advantages
SI127E-00611-P30017 1 SI127E-00611 27.57 41.29 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantages it's that they will take a lot of time out of the students to get ready for it and then shower after doing those fitness classes

SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  8.29 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so today we are going to go through the whole process from how the honey goes from a flower to the shop
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611  8.29 15.45 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so firstly the bees are collecting the nectar from the flowers especially during the spring
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 15.45 22.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> they are making that honey nectar in their beehives which there are their homes
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 22.82 43.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so once the bee collectors are staring at those beehives and see that there's a bunch of honey they collect it and they send it to the manufacturing companies that they actually put it into individual recipients
SI127E-00611-P40018 1 SI127E-00611 43.20 57.31 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and after that those companies are the ones that transport it and sell it to the stores that then we are able to get it from there when we go to the supermarkets
SI127E-00611-P50019 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> based on my personal experience a candidate that is trying to choose a country where to study abroad the first thing that they have to take into account is the language because otherwise it is going to be very difficult for them to follow all the classes and to be integrated in the classroom
SI127E-00611-P50020 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.77 <o,Q5,C,P5> so the benefits of studying in a second language they are very clear because you get to know more people and you are able to travel by yourself to more countries where you are going to have more possibilities to express yourself to other people
SI127E-00611-P50021 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  5.02 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that there are many barriers that you could face when studying in another country
SI127E-00611-P50021 1 SI127E-00611  5.02 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> for instance not only the language itself because you can learn that but the traditions and the culture in there at the very beginning can be very shocking for a foreign student
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611  0.00  8.46 <o,Q5,C,P5> when you are abroad you have to really learn the local culture by hanging out with locals
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611  8.46 16.39 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you just keep hanging out with the international people you are not going to be immerse in that
SI127E-00611-P50022 1 SI127E-00611 16.39 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> and it is not going to be as beneficial as possible
SI127E-00611-P50023 1 SI127E-00611  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> personally i totally agree with that statement because for many people when you study abroad it is the first time becoming independent without your parents and you learn how to actually manage all your economy your house and all doing the groceries and everything

SI127E-00774-P50020 1 SI127E-00774  0.00 16.36 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion i prefer to attend to a face to face class because i think i can focus more on what the teachers is saying and i can take better notes
SI127E-00774-P50021 1 SI127E-00774  0.00  8.93 <o,Q5,B2,P5> working on group projects is a good way to work because it has a lot of benefits for everyone in the group

SI127E-00774-P50022 1 SI127E-00774  0.00 13.96 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well i think that attending to lectures is worse than reading for your own because you are not as focused as if you were who is reading
SI127E-00774-P50022 1 SI127E-00774 13.96 19.26 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and that's why i think it's better reading for your own

SI127E-00900-P30017 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 22.08 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion students have to work to pay their university studies if their families don't have the enough resources to affront that cost but i think if they have the support the economic support of their families they should not work
SI127E-00900-P30017 1 SI127E-00900 22.08 59.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> because i think that the advantage of work to pay the studies is that you have an economy independence and you don't have to depend on your parents but it is going to take you many time that you must be studying or many rest time that you need to have energy and to improve and to have good results on your studies on your university studies

SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900  7.83 11.93 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as we can see the first step is that you have to travel to the airport
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 11.93 14.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> you can do it by car by train or by bus
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 14.77 21.16 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to do the check in on your travel company
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 21.16 26.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this is the first step
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 26.05 41.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the next step is that you have to pass the document control with the police and then you have to pass the security control where they are going to check your luggage
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 41.14 44.34 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then you have to wait before the boarding time
SI127E-00900-P40018 1 SI127E-00900 44.34 53.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> in the airport you have many things to do like shopping have a coffee have a lunch

SI127E-00900-P50019 1 SI127E-00900  0.00 15.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think that the students search on internet to many different articles that can help us to improve their learning

SI127E-00900-P50022 1 SI127E-00900  0.00  8.70 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me it works better reading alone because i prefer to be myself with my thoughts

SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271  7.25 13.40 <o,Q5,B2,P4> well first of all bees collect nectar from flowers
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 13.40 17.80 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and with this nectar bees make honey in their beehives
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 17.80 22.18 <o,Q5,B2,P4> then the beekeepers take the honey from the beehives
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 22.18 29.82 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and the next step is to put the honey in a receipt so as to be distribute in shops
SI127E-01271-P40018 1 SI127E-01271 29.82 35.81 <o,Q5,B2,P4> and finally the honey is in a stock so people can buy it

SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 13.08 38.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> one of the advantage is that you can get the job experience to explore what you are interested in and also try to figure out that what the student need in the future like specific skills and anything that the student can learn
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 38.30 45.48 <o,Q5,C,P3> and also the disadvantage will be that the focus will be on the job not the study
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 45.48 50.70 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in my opinion that the student should do a little bit of a job
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 50.70 55.70 <o,Q5,C,P3> however they should mainly focus on their study in the university
SI127E-01294-P30017 1 SI127E-01294 55.70 61.46 <o,Q5,C,P3> and in that way you can explore your interest
SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294  0.00 11.09 <o,Q5,C,P4> so nowadays a lot of people travel a lot so i will present about how to travel by the airplane

SI127E-01294-P40018 1 SI127E-01294 19.95 24.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> so once you get to the airport you have to check in

SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 27.65 36.64 <o,Q5,C,P4> there's also a security control where the luggage you'll board with you on the plane will be checked
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 36.64 46.08 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you will you be free to wait in an area where you can buy presents eat something or you can go to the bathroom
SI127E-01383-P40018 1 SI127E-01383 46.08 49.78 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you'll finally be able to board on your plane

SI127E-01383-P50020 1 SI127E-01383  0.00  5.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my opinion times are changing and there are a lot of people that have start learning virtually

SI127E-01528-P10008 1 SI127E-01528  1.71  4.57 <o,Q5,B1,P1> in the future i would like to be airline pilot
SI127E-01528-P10008 1 SI127E-01528  4.57 19.46 <o,Q5,B1,P1> so there are two reasons to be airline pilot and first one is i like to control something and second one is i like to member in the team

SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528  0.00 26.99 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so there are two advantages that students get jobs to pay for their university studies and the first one is students can improve the like communication skill in the job part time job and second one is that they can learn about how to use money to use
SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528 26.99 42.44 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and the disadvantages is that if they have so much like work it's gonna be they don't have much time to study which is the most important for student
SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528 42.44 52.30 <o,Q5,B1,P3> and in my opinion i recommend that students should get jobs
SI127E-01528-P30017 1 SI127E-01528 52.30 59.87 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i mean you know like communication skills and experience in the job is very useful and important for society
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  7.11 <o,Q5,B1,P4> all right so i am talking about what we need to do to travel by airplane
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528  7.11 12.54 <o,Q5,B1,P4> so there are one two three four five six seven eight procedures
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 12.54 21.01 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and first step is that we travel to airport by car by bus or by train
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 21.01 30.25 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then when you arrived at airport you have to check in to the counter
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 30.25 37.91 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and you have to show the document about yourself and the counter people check the document
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 37.91 43.88 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then also you have to check the security your security
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 43.88 52.89 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then you can have time to wait to like take a rest or drink a coffee
SI127E-01528-P40018 1 SI127E-01528 52.89 59.87 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and then after that you will board to the airplane and then enjoy your flying
SI127E-01528-P50019 1 SI127E-01528  0.00  6.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> okay so i talking about how can use technology more effectively to study
SI127E-01528-P50019 1 SI127E-01528  6.38 16.96 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and i think the best way to use technology to study is to use like a application in the smartphone

SI127E-01528-P50020 1 SI127E-01528  2.27 12.37 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i mean you know face to face like studying and learning is that good for like communication with other people

SI127E-01528-P50021 1 SI127E-01528  6.54 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P5> for example like if there is someone who doesn't know about it and someone can teach to someone that is good

SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 10.45 26.26 <o,Q5,B2,P3> one good advantage is when you are working and studying at the same time you can use the theory learns and knowledge that you are getting when you are studying and put it in practice when you work
SI127E-01573-P30017 1 SI127E-01573 26.26 34.20 <o,Q5,B2,P3> at the same time that part time work give you some economy resources that you can use in your daily basis

SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826  0.00 10.09 <o,Q5,B2,P3> as you know nowadays all university courses should include a period of practical work experience and it is very good

SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 16.13 33.41 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the highest advantage of that is that it could help you to get a lot of new knowledge or new experience or something that you would be using in the future in your area of your work
SI127E-01826-P30017 1 SI127E-01826 33.41 37.64 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but there are lot of disadvantages

SI127E-01961-P10008 1 SI127E-01961 10.14 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i would like to just speak another language like chinese
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 16.82 <o,Q5,C,P3> one of the advantage of working as a student it's to be financially independent and also to know how professional environment works and how to manage different environment
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 16.82 20.95 <o,Q5,C,P3> but there is also backfires to this
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 20.95 26.79 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example one of the most inconvenient thing is we can be tired
SI127E-01961-P30017 1 SI127E-01961 26.79 33.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> i mean students could be tired from their part time jobs

SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961  0.00  7.69 <o,Q4,C,P4> acid rain is one of the most damage phenomenon to the environment today
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961  7.69 12.56 <o,Q4,C,P4> but how this forms in the environment

SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 33.16 41.41 <o,Q4,C,P4> just a reminder that clouds are made up with water and acid particles become a part of the cloud
SI127E-01961-P40018 1 SI127E-01961 41.41 59.98 <o,Q4,C,P4> in consequence depends on the temperature rain or snow may contain a large part of particles and acid particles which is lead to acid rain or acid snow which can be really damage to the environment
SI127E-01961-P50019 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 18.81 <o,Q5,C,P5> healthier lifestyle start with nutrition and as far as i'm concerned we must forbidden eating between meals and drink a lot of water like about one point five litre day or two litres per day
SI127E-01961-P50019 1 SI127E-01961 18.81 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> whatever
SI127E-01961-P50020 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 14.13 <o,Q5,C,P5> our bodies are made with ninety percent of water so we should keep that level all the day because this is where our bodies take all the energy
SI127E-01961-P50020 1 SI127E-01961 14.13 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> so we should drink a lot of water about two litres per day
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961  0.00  5.80 <o,Q5,C,P5> more we sleep more our life duration is
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961  5.80 13.12 <o,Q5,C,P5> so in my opinion we should keep constant the eight hours of sleeping each night
SI127E-01961-P50022 1 SI127E-01961 13.12 18.37 <o,Q5,C,P5> and even ten hours would be perfect for an adult for example
SI127E-01961-P50023 1 SI127E-01961  0.00 13.57 <o,Q5,C,P5> the advantage of technology is that now we can track every aspect of our bodies and our health and we don't have to go to the doctor all the time
SI127E-01961-P50023 1 SI127E-01961 13.57 19.86 <o,Q5,C,P5> but the other part is we such dependent of that

SI127E-01965-P10006 1 SI127E-01965 12.86 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> that way i can really learn the details and dance with them with my partner

SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 13.32 31.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> firstly the advantages i see while studying and doing part time jobs would be that they will have way more money to do things in their free time and to pay for their studying fees
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 31.27 34.47 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in the other hand we have the disadvantages
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 34.47 47.54 <o,Q4,B2,P3> one big important disadvantages would be having less time to study which could lead to having lower grades
SI127E-01965-P30017 1 SI127E-01965 47.54 51.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so it will be a bit more difficult

SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 12.78 19.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first the vehicles and factories make smoke which makes pollution
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 19.70 28.03 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then the acid particles that are in that smoke cause the acid particles carried by the wind
SI127E-01965-P40018 1 SI127E-01965 28.03 41.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the wind makes some acid particles fall as dust which could lead to the river and some lakes to be less clean

SI127E-01965-P50019 1 SI127E-01965  0.00 14.14 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i would recommend to go to a nutritionist so they can tell them exactly what they need and what their body needs to have the full energy throughout the day
SI127E-01965-P50021 1 SI127E-01965  0.00  4.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i don't think we need to do exercise every day
SI127E-01965-P50021 1 SI127E-01965  4.07 15.34 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but i think it's very important to do exercise at least two or three times a week so our body can keep up its shape and be in a healthy weight
SI127E-01965-P50023 1 SI127E-01965  0.00 12.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> generally technology has really improved our health because we don't have to waste as much energy as we used to with our new technology
SI127E-01965-P50023 1 SI127E-01965 12.86 17.38 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think it was a better improvement
SI127E-01981-P10005 1 SI127E-01981  0.00  7.44 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i'm so interested because you can learn about other cultures
SI127E-01981-P10005 1 SI127E-01981  7.44 13.12 <o,Q4,B1,P1> so i think is positive in all her sides
SI127E-01981-P10007 1 SI127E-01981  0.00 15.17 <o,Q5,B1,P1> maybe the best way is talking with other people of england or united state and you can learn too much about english
SI127E-01981-P10008 1 SI127E-01981  0.00  5.10 <o,Q4,B1,P1> maybe the italian language
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981  0.00 19.07 <o,Q5,B1,P3> some advantages that jobs while student are studying are that you maybe knows the real life and you can afford and pay some things that maybe help your parents in the university
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 19.07 31.29 <o,Q5,B1,P3> in the other hand some disadvantages are that you don't have too much time for study and you will sleep less
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 31.29 44.79 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but in my opinion i think that you are going to learn more about responsibilities and meet other people other work people
SI127E-01981-P30017 1 SI127E-01981 44.79 50.49 <o,Q5,B1,P3> so definitely it's a good form to spend your time

SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 18.49 29.59 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and finally we find that particles in the clouds of the planet because are carried by the wind after

SI127E-01981-P40018 1 SI127E-01981 46.39 55.60 <o,Q5,B1,P4> and we have to change that to have a better planet
SI127E-01981-P50019 1 SI127E-01981  0.00 19.60 <o,Q4,B1,P5> maybe i think that good habit for eating is eats a lot of fruit five times for a day and eat some salad food two times at week
SI127E-01981-P50020 1 SI127E-01981  0.00  9.56 <o,Q5,B1,P5> it's too important to drinking water because sometimes we confuse about drinking water or be hungry

SI127E-01981-P50023 1 SI127E-01981  0.00 17.20 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think that it's depends of the use of the technology that people make because you can use technology for doing better exercise but maybe you can use technology to watch netflix

SI12BD-00042-P30017 1 SI12BD-00042  5.08 14.08 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so having a part time job could bring the same benefit and the same disdvantage at the same time

SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042  6.52 17.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain is a common problem nowadays and we have to find a way of eliminate it
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 17.35 21.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> the vehicles and the factories as we all know cause pollution
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 21.38 30.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and this pollution usually create acid particles that go into the smoke of these factories
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 30.92 39.33 <o,Q4,B2,P4> these acid particles could be carried by wind and could also mix in the clouds with water
SI12BD-00042-P40018 1 SI12BD-00042 39.33 56.58 <o,Q4,B2,P4> if this happen then acid rain is going to fall onto the ground and damage the environment as well as humans animals and the fields of the farmers for example

SI12BD-00089-P50019 1 SI12BD-00089  5.98 12.80 <o,Q4,B2,P5> after that it should be the climate of the country whether the student are suitable for it

SI12BD-00089-P50020 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well the benefit of that is that first of all you can really know how to speak a second language and after that in lots of second language country the culture is so different and it's a joy to learn in other language to know their culture by that
SI12BD-00089-P50021 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00 13.39 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well first of all the difficult must come from the influence by the culture because they were so many different habit of other countries' people
SI12BD-00089-P50021 1 SI12BD-00089 13.39 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and also the difficult may be because of the language course
SI12BD-00089-P50022 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00  9.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well the fast way for a student to learn about the local culture is to become friends with some local people
SI12BD-00089-P50022 1 SI12BD-00089  9.55 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and in that case they can take you to maybe their festivals and in that case they can learn about the culture
SI12BD-00089-P50023 1 SI12BD-00089  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i agree with that kind of idea because when you study at the other country is mostly likely that you are on your own and you have to do everything by yourself because there are no parents long with you and so in that case you can become more independent

SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 12.45 27.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but i also think that there are some disadvantages added to it that is that the time that they are going to spend on those jobs they aren't going to be able to use for studying
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 27.55 37.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and well studying is very important for having a better job in the future so it could be a downbreak
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 37.92 54.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion it's a good thing having a job and not just because of the money but also because of the future prospect that the students will have about their future jobs
SI12BD-00095-P30017 1 SI12BD-00095 54.70 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they will have a first experience to know how it going to be

SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 17.23 29.54 <o,Q4,B2,P4> for example we are not able to go with metallic gadgets or any kind of white arms

SI12BD-00095-P40018 1 SI12BD-00095 42.73 53.46 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so we can spend in the cafeteria restaurants or any kind of gift shop that there are in the airport

SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 13.00 16.30 <o,Q4,C,P3> so you gain experience in the area
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 16.30 25.53 <o,Q4,C,P3> and you also start to know people who's working in this area and you can build some networking in the field
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 25.53 38.48 <o,Q4,C,P3> well i also think that it has disadvantages coz working and studying requires time and is a huge responsibility which could be so stressful
SI12BD-00135-P30017 1 SI12BD-00135 38.48 59.98 <o,Q4,C,P3> at the end i think that it is very useful and students should do part time jobs while they are studying because at the end it has a positive impact in your experience and it could help you to find a job

SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135  3.21  6.82 <o,Q4,B2,P4> acid rain is caused by pollution
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135  6.82 15.70 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this pollution is principally emitted by factories and vehicles and we're talking about smoke
SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 15.70 24.24 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this smoke has some acid particles and these acid particles are carried by wind

SI12BD-00135-P40018 1 SI12BD-00135 45.70 59.98 <o,Q4,B2,P4> this acid rain is toxic so it has severe damages to our environment because not only damage our plants but also microorganisms in our soil
SI12BD-00135-P50019 1 SI12BD-00135  0.00  7.10 <o,Q4,B2,P5> my advice to this people is that they plan their meals
SI12BD-00135-P50019 1 SI12BD-00135  7.10 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it could help you to be prepare when you have hungry and not full in this junk food that you can find in the streets

SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135  4.30 10.56 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but the recommendation is that you should drink at least two liters of water every day
SI12BD-00135-P50020 1 SI12BD-00135 10.56 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's what our body needs to maintain hydratation

SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135  1.72  6.69 <o,Q4,B2,P5> in my opinion is vital to do exercise every day
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135  6.69 11.71 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the recommendation is to do at least thirty minutes of exercise
SI12BD-00135-P50021 1 SI12BD-00135 11.71 19.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> this can improve our health in a good way

SI12BD-00150-P10005 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 18.37 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am interested in learning about other countries so much because i think learning more about others countries can have a deeper insight into other cultures and broaden my horizons
SI12BD-00150-P10006 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i enjoy spending my free time by reading books watching movies watching drama series and have an out with my friends
SI12BD-00150-P10007 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> as for improving my oral english i think it is better to speak as much as possible with your foreign friends and read as much as possible too
SI12BD-00150-P10008 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00  9.88 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i think it could be cooking because cooking is a important skill for independent life
SI12BD-00150-P10008 1 SI12BD-00150  9.88 20.41 <o,Q4,B1,P1> and through cooking i can make delicious meals for my families to spread happiness and well being
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 21.38 <o,Q5,B2,P3> i think the advantages are students can get more practical skills and combine what they have learned in their textbooks with their experiences through doing part time jobs
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 21.38 33.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are that they may be easily distracted from class and leading to their poor grades
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 33.61 40.17 <o,Q5,B2,P3> so i think it is better to strike a balance between doing part time jobs and study
SI12BD-00150-P30017 1 SI12BD-00150 40.17 60.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and students should make the most appropriate part time jobs for themselves so because part time jobs vary from person to person and they should choose their individual jobs
SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150  0.00 17.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> pollution given off from factories and the vehicles contains smoke which acid particles are in

SI12BD-00150-P40018 1 SI12BD-00150 39.19 60.91 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and acid rain can do harm to the environment which has raised people's awareness of it

SI12BD-00162-P30017 1 SI12BD-00162 21.60 45.61 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example you can make money if you work while you are studying but you spend a lot of time and this time you should spend study if you want passed the exam of the university

SI12BD-00398-P10006 1 SI12BD-00398  0.00  4.81 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think read news every day is very important
SI12BD-00398-P10006 1 SI12BD-00398  4.81 10.75 <o,Q4,B2,P1> we need to understand what happens in our surrounding every day

SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398  5.08 16.38 <o,Q4,B2,P3> speaking for advantages maybe university students can get more work experience through the practice work process
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 16.38 30.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but students didn't have too much time to work in the university because students in the university maybe the most important task is study
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 30.67 40.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> they need to focus on their classes to get more profession knowledge about their major
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 40.55 46.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so maybe sometimes they can't balance the time of study and working
SI12BD-00398-P30017 1 SI12BD-00398 46.98 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion i think maybe some university classes can include some practice work experience but not all of them

SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 11.71 <o,Q4,C,P3> i do not agree with the statement that all university student should do some part time jobs
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 11.71 17.64 <o,Q4,C,P3> there is an advantage of doing a part time job as a student
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 17.64 30.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> obviously you can learn how to earn money and obviously as a student you need to spend a lot of money on tuition fees and your daily lives
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 30.41 33.92 <o,Q4,C,P3> but on the other hand you have to balance your time
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 33.92 38.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> you have to study in the library
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 38.22 42.65 <o,Q4,C,P3> if you're a student the main thing you've got to do is studying
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 42.65 54.95 <o,Q4,C,P3> so if enough money and your focus is on studying a subject you do not have to do apartment job
SI12BD-00499-P30017 1 SI12BD-00499 54.95 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> so this is the reason why i do not agree with the sentence

SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 12.29 28.92 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all acid particles are created via emission of pollution from factories and vehicles and any other sources
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 28.92 44.50 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and then acid particles as smoke go up in the air and within that air acid particles are carried by wind and it forms cloud
SI12BD-00499-P40018 1 SI12BD-00499 44.50 54.88 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some acid directly falls to the ground and damage the soils or ponds river ocean

SI12BD-00499-P50019 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think a good eating habit is eating breakfast lunch and dinner at the same time every day and not eating too many sweets and alcohols
SI12BD-00499-P50020 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think it is extremely important to drink water regularly instead of drinking only coffees or alcohol and sugary beverages because it dehydrates your body
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 10.04 <o,Q4,C,P5> it's not essential to do exercise every single day but it is important to do some exercise
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499 10.04 17.61 <o,Q4,C,P5> it depends on your age your gender and what level of healthiness you're looking for
SI12BD-00499-P50021 1 SI12BD-00499 17.61 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> but certainly doing exercise is good for you
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499  0.00 11.40 <o,Q4,C,P5> i do not necessarily agree that every single person need eight hours of sleep every day
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499 11.40 18.29 <o,Q4,C,P5> on average it would be good to have eight hours' sleep but again depending on a person
SI12BD-00499-P50022 1 SI12BD-00499 18.29 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> he may only need six hours
SI12BD-00535-P10005 1 SI12BD-00535  0.00 11.57 <o,Q4,C,P1> i see environment as a pretty serious issue coz nowadays people tend to create a lot of waste
SI12BD-00535-P10005 1 SI12BD-00535 11.57 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P1> so normally when i go out i bring my own bottle own container for food et cetera

SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 10.24 31.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> the negative points the disadvantages are the students may get too tired after the exercise and they will become very sweaty in the way that the classroom will fill with bad smells
SI12BD-00535-P30017 1 SI12BD-00535 31.21 53.67 <o,Q5,C,P3> on the other hand the advantages are the students may be able to keep fit and to be more able to focused on what they are learning coz there's a study saying that exercise can help people to get focused

SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535  6.47 11.20 <o,Q5,C,P4> there are six steps of it
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 11.20 14.29 <o,Q5,C,P4> and it's from the flower to shop
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 14.29 20.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> so first of all the bees have to collect nectar from the flowers
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 20.84 26.88 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that they will make honey from nectar in beehives
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 26.88 36.68 <o,Q5,C,P4> after making the honey the beekeepers will collect the honey from the beehives and then put it into the jar
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 36.68 48.04 <o,Q5,C,P4> after that the jars will be shipped to the supermarkets or the stores that sells the honey
SI12BD-00535-P40018 1 SI12BD-00535 48.04 57.11 <o,Q5,C,P4> and in the end the customers will get the honey from the supermarket

SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535  0.00 12.88 <o,Q5,C,P5> students may find it difficult about the culture when they study in another country because different country have different cultures
SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535 12.88 17.71 <o,Q5,C,P5> it might be extremely opposite from their home country
SI12BD-00535-P50021 1 SI12BD-00535 17.71 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> so they need time to adapt
SI12BD-00535-P50022 1 SI12BD-00535  0.00  9.34 <o,Q5,C,P5> students can learn about the local culture by making some local friends in the country
SI12BD-00535-P50022 1 SI12BD-00535  9.34 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> like this they can all hang out together in a way that they can experience the local culture
SI12BD-00535-P50023 1 SI12BD-00535  0.00  9.11 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think studying abroad indeed helps students to become more independent
SI12BD-00535-P50023 1 SI12BD-00535  9.11 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> as for me i used to study abroad for a year and that makes me more important because i have to do everything on my own including cooking
SI12BD-00547-P10005 1 SI12BD-00547  0.00 16.36 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i love learning about new countries new languages new cultures because i think that the more you know about new societies different societies and new ways of thinking the better person you can become

SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547  0.00  5.55 <o,Q4,C,P3> all university students should do part time jobs while they're studying
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547  5.55 26.67 <o,Q4,C,P3> in my opinion this should be optional for the students because on the one hand the ones who don't work would have the opportunity to check how real life works and put into practice the theory they learn in class
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 26.67 47.19 <o,Q4,C,P3> on the other hand for those who already worked for self support or to support their families it would be a great disadvantage because they wouldn't be able to leave their real jobs and look for something that may not be rewarding in question of money
SI12BD-00547-P30017 1 SI12BD-00547 47.19 51.75 <o,Q4,C,P3> i've been through this situation and it was really exhausting

SI12BD-01064-P10005 1 SI12BD-01064  0.00 17.73 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i am very interested in environment and also i am worried because people use a lot of plastics and we aren't concerned about this
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064  0.00  6.05 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well we love go to the cinema in summer go to the beach
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064  6.05  8.82 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but the summer is a little different
SI12BD-01064-P10006 1 SI12BD-01064  8.82 17.92 <o,Q4,B1,P1> but we love go out together and go running or other sports

SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064  0.00 18.45 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well in my opinion the advantage of doing fitness classes in the school time is that all students can practice a sport and so they are more healthy
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 18.45 40.33 <o,Q4,B1,P3> and the disadvantage is that in the school they need to reduce the time of other subjects maybe maths or maybe language or i don't know but need to reduce another subject
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 40.33 57.20 <o,Q4,B1,P3> in my opinion it's a good idea because children and teenagers usually don't practise sport and it's very important for their health
SI12BD-01064-P30017 1 SI12BD-01064 57.20 59.87 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so it's a good idea

SI131R-00030-P50022 1 SI131R-00030  0.00 11.98 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think attending lectures would be a better because the professor and advisor will help you to point out your further study direction

SI131R-00030-P50023 1 SI131R-00030  0.00  7.45 <o,Q4,B2,P5> modern learning facilities could bring advanced knowledge around the world

SI131R-00030-P50023 1 SI131R-00030 15.96 19.26 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so i think it's very important
SI131R-00045-P10005 1 SI131R-00045  0.00  6.62 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i believe that learning about other countries and their culture is very important
SI131R-00045-P10005 1 SI131R-00045  6.62 19.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> since i am a teacher i consider to be really important because in this way you know the people and how they work

SI131R-00045-P10007 1 SI131R-00045  0.00 15.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> from my perspective the best way to improve your english is to use it in a real way for example speaking with people whose first language is english for example

SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045  0.00 11.82 <o,Q4,B2,P3> having a part time job during our university studies can bring some advantages and some disadvantages
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 11.82 20.88 <o,Q4,B2,P3> a disadvantage could be that you can have less time to do your homework for example
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 20.88 44.53 <o,Q4,B2,P3> an advantage could be that if your part time job is related to the career then it will help you because you will apply what you are learning in the university and if it doesn't work you can learn from that experience
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 44.53 51.24 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion it's very important for students to have a part time job
SI131R-00045-P30017 1 SI131R-00045 51.24 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however this part time job must be related to their bachelor degrees so it will learn more
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045  0.00  6.26 <o,Q5,C,P4> it is well known that rain is a natural phenomena
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045  6.26 11.56 <o,Q5,C,P4> however factories and vehicles produce pollution
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 11.56 16.36 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this pollution is mainly acid particles in smoke
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 16.36 19.84 <o,Q5,C,P4> and these particles are carried by the wind
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 19.84 24.63 <o,Q5,C,P4> and some particles falls as dust
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 24.63 48.99 <o,Q5,C,P4> on the other hand there're other particles that mix with the clouds and these clouds producing water or snow make fall this acid particles over the trees over the animals even over of our cars
SI131R-00045-P40018 1 SI131R-00045 48.99 58.33 <o,Q5,C,P4> and this can be harmful and it damages the nature
SI131R-00045-P50020 1 SI131R-00045  0.00 11.37 <o,Q5,B2,P5> since our bodies are conformed of ninety six percent of water it's very important that we drink water
SI131R-00045-P50020 1 SI131R-00045 11.37 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however as you said before drinking lots of water maybe can be very harmful
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045  0.00  8.06 <o,Q5,B2,P5> maybe doing exercise every day can be excessive if you are a beginner in this field
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045  8.06 15.55 <o,Q5,B2,P5> however maybe three days per week can be very effective if you want to have a healthy life
SI131R-00045-P50021 1 SI131R-00045 15.55 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and then you can go on and work harder
SI131R-00045-P50022 1 SI131R-00045  0.00  5.89 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in my own perspective i consider that it depends on the person

SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048  0.00 22.86 <o,Q4,B2,P3> well i think university students want to pay their own studies because it's really difficult for families to get the amount of the money that you need to pay your studies
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 22.86 30.31 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so the advantage well you are independent of your family and are economically independent
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 30.31 40.92 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantages are obviously you have less time to study so that's not good for your degree
SI131R-00048-P30017 1 SI131R-00048 40.92 58.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> in my opinion for me it's more important the independence and not to be a charge for your family so you need to have a job and be able to pay your own studies
SI131R-00048-P40018 1 SI131R-00048  0.00 18.05 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all you have to travel to the airport so you could do this travel by train on a bus or by car

SI131R-00048-P50022 1 SI131R-00048  0.00 13.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it depends because in some occasions when you attending lectures you learn a lot because the teacher it's good at his job
SI131R-00048-P50022 1 SI131R-00048 13.63 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but in other locations attending lectures is not effective because it's the same that you read alone
SI131R-00048-P50023 1 SI131R-00048  0.00  8.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> it's important because the way that the students learn is changing all the time
SI131R-00048-P50023 1 SI131R-00048  8.20 19.60 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so that's important to modernise your style of teach to be attractive for the students

SI131R-00058-P30017 1 SI131R-00058 12.52 25.14 <o,Q5,B2,P3> but one of the disadvantage is to lose study in university

SI131R-00240-P50021 1 SI131R-00240  9.12 15.75 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for me most important one is communication and the only way to improve it it is speaking

SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 13.54 22.76 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in future they can add it on their c vs so enterprise contract thems

SI131R-00274-P30017 1 SI131R-00274 38.22 48.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and if you are working obviously you aren't gonna have the total time to dedicate to your career

SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274  8.31 21.38 <o,Q4,B2,P4> depending of the facilities of the city you could go by tram or train by bus or by your own or taxi or your own car

SI131R-00274-P40018 1 SI131R-00274 47.47 58.02 <o,Q4,B2,P4> when you pass the security control probably you have to wait in a waiting room or you can go to a cafe

SI131R-00274-P50019 1 SI131R-00274  0.00 12.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> for example i have an ipad so when i am not in the mood for being studied i would prefer to stay in bed but as i say i have to study
SI131R-00274-P50019 1 SI131R-00274 12.41 19.89 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i could bring my ipad to the bed and study my notes being warm in my bed
SI131R-00274-P50020 1 SI131R-00274  0.00  7.30 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well obviously it depend of the teacher and the subject that are you studying
SI131R-00274-P50020 1 SI131R-00274  7.30 16.63 <o,Q4,B2,P5> but in my own experience i will say that i prefer a book rather than a teacher
SI131R-00274-P50021 1 SI131R-00274  0.00  7.88 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so first of all if you work in groups you'll have to deal with people

SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291  6.04 19.41 <o,Q4,C,P3> i firmly believe that taking a short time per day to have some exercise would be a really good benefit for students to being active
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 19.41 32.14 <o,Q4,C,P3> and as well there are also some disadvantages like for example schools will miss time for doing their lessons like for example science
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 32.14 39.02 <o,Q4,C,P3> and another parts would be that's maybe some students don't want to do exercise
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 39.02 42.22 <o,Q4,C,P3> so they will lost time at the school
SI131R-00291-P30017 1 SI131R-00291 42.22 57.56 <o,Q4,C,P3> but although all this advantages and disadvantages i firmly believe that this idea it's really good and it should be recognized by schools and schools should take part to go ahead

SI131R-00291-P40018 1 SI131R-00291 17.44 29.42 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they collect the nectar and they bring the nectar to their home where they make honey from nectar in beehives

SI131R-00345-P50023 1 SI131R-00345  0.00 13.44 <o,Q4,B1,P5> the technology is very good because i help for running

SI131R-00372-P10005 1 SI131R-00372  8.83 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> it has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and the dining room is very big
SI131R-00372-P10006 1 SI131R-00372  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i really like spending time with my friends going for a walk or listen to music sometimes watching a film or reading an interesting book you know
SI131R-00372-P10007 1 SI131R-00372  0.00  3.45 <o,Q5,B1,P1> my only brother
SI131R-00372-P10007 1 SI131R-00372  3.45 19.94 <o,Q5,B1,P1> he's very special and we really like going for a walk you know around the forest or talking about any kind of issue or topic

SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372  0.00 17.20 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think that one of the advantages is that if you don't have a lot of time to study you concentrate better and your time is more effective

SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 27.38 34.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i think you have to be very careful if you get a job while you're studying
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 34.65 47.67 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion if you can don't work at the same time but sometimes life challenge us
SI131R-00372-P30017 1 SI131R-00372 47.67 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so why i can tell you go for it and study and work like is the best thing you do

SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372  8.64 24.20 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all you have to go to the airport in some transport like by car or by bus or train
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 24.20 40.84 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you arrived to the airport and it's time to do the check in pass through document control and then the security wards will see if everything is okay
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 40.84 43.57 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you have to wait in the waiting room
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 43.57 51.10 <o,Q4,B1,P4> you can eat something or go to the bathroom or restroom or drink a coffee
SI131R-00372-P40018 1 SI131R-00372 51.10 60.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and finally they will call you on board and it's time to take off the plane
SI131R-00372-P50019 1 SI131R-00372  0.00 13.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so they can search information in the internet to improve their knowledge

SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 18.74 23.55 <o,Q3,B2,P3> but in my own opinion most of the students there are not able to pay for college
SI131R-00374-P30017 1 SI131R-00374 23.55 25.64 <o,Q3,B2,P3> they are already doing part time jobs

SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 23.25 33.28 <o,Q3,B2,P4> so when this water in the clouds they precipitate as rain or snow is not just water or snow that is raining
SI131R-00374-P40018 1 SI131R-00374 33.28 36.62 <o,Q3,B2,P4> is water and snow or snow plus acid

SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475  8.54 10.53 <o,Q4,B1,P3> i have two reasons
SI131R-00475-P30017 1 SI131R-00475 10.53 19.87 <o,Q4,B1,P3> first we should study on focus in universities

SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475  0.00  9.14 <o,Q4,B1,P4> okay i will tell you about travelling by airplane
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475  9.14 20.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first you arrive at airplane by transportation like a car or a bus or train
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 20.93 37.39 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then you have to check in and you go to document control to check your bags and luggage
SI131R-00475-P40018 1 SI131R-00475 37.39 52.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> third step you should wait at hall and you can go bathroom and eat lunch

SI131R-00475-P50019 1 SI131R-00475  0.00 16.02 <o,Q4,B1,P5> we can use technology instead of our brain because i think we use brain to use only consider
SI131R-00475-P50020 1 SI131R-00475  0.00 14.22 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think face to face is important things because we can communicate with people on face to face
SI131R-00475-P50020 1 SI131R-00475 14.22 19.09 <o,Q4,B1,P5> we express our feelings
SI131R-00475-P50022 1 SI131R-00475  0.00  8.13 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think attending lecture is better than studying alone

SI131R-00475-P50023 1 SI131R-00475  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think it is necessary to provide learning modern facilities because we must catch up with era so we can get knowledge
SI131R-00512-P10005 1 SI131R-00512  0.00 13.48 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i am really interested in learning about other countries because for my career i need to learn of other culture how they deal with the bargains and all these things
SI131R-00512-P10005 1 SI131R-00512 13.48 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so i prefer to take advantage from know about this cultures and make my deals
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  4.26 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm keen on doing exercise
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512  4.26  5.99 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's really important for me
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512  5.99 17.03 <o,Q4,B2,P1> for example i'm going to the gym and make some exercise with the dumbbells and well i feel stronger and feel good with myself
SI131R-00512-P10006 1 SI131R-00512 17.03 20.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so for me it's incredible
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  4.29 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i get a buzz from listening music
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512  4.29 15.63 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it's incredible because you can put your headphones and improve your skills in english because you can listen some words that you never listen in your life
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 15.63 18.57 <o,Q4,B2,P1> so that is the best way to learn
SI131R-00512-P10007 1 SI131R-00512 18.57 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and maybe reading
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  8.91 <o,Q4,B2,P1> well i would prefer learning gymnastic rather than learn about i don't know other topics
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512  8.91 16.85 <o,Q4,B2,P1> because it's very important for me that movements feel great with me and with my body
SI131R-00512-P10008 1 SI131R-00512 16.85 20.97 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i want to reach my limits
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512  0.00  4.16 <o,Q4,B2,P3> many students at this moment do part time jobs
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512  4.16  9.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> however this have many advantages
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512  9.07 19.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> you can develop new skills and the things that professional environment wants to other people improve your know how about the things that you learn in the school
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 19.75 29.60 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the other hand the disadvantages of this is that there are many students don't have time or maybe are not very organised to do these things
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 29.60 32.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and is difficult for many people yes
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 32.62 50.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but however in my opinion you need to do this and take the risk to make the both things because in the future many companies will be impressed about your story that how do you know all this things
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 50.50 57.69 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and well you can say ah well i was a student and employee
SI131R-00512-P30017 1 SI131R-00512 57.69 60.35 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so i can do the both

SI131R-00512-P40018 1 SI131R-00512 44.55 55.35 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and they could suffer some dramatically situations because the environment is not the best for us at this moment

SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 40.75 49.37 <o,Q5,C,P4> then you have to pass to an area where you have to wait till you can board to the airplane
SI131R-00597-P40018 1 SI131R-00597 49.37 57.32 <o,Q5,C,P4> and finally you board to the airplane and then you are ready to go out to your destination

SI131R-00597-P50020 1 SI131R-00597  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,C,P5> i agree with them because when we have virtual classes we don't pay the same attention than when we have a face to face professor coz we don't feel the pressure of giving our hundred percent in the class
SI131R-00597-P50021 1 SI131R-00597  0.00 18.20 <o,Q4,C,P5> i think that the most important skill that we develop is that we get to improve our communication and also to be very patient with our friends because sometimes we get very stressful that they don't do anything

SI137O-00037-P50019 1 SI137O-00037  0.00  9.92 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think we can use technology to search for some difficult questions that teachers may not answer
SI137O-00037-P50019 1 SI137O-00037  9.92 18.58 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and we can also use technology to watch some videos about some important question
SI137O-00037-P50020 1 SI137O-00037  0.00 19.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> yes i think learning from us teacher face to face is the best way because students can learn from teachers' movements and get a better understanding and teacher can get students' feedback very quickly and give them answer

SI137O-00037-P50022 1 SI137O-00037  0.00 14.66 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think attending a lecture is very important because the lecturer the speaker of the lecture are also the specialist of the area and they can give you a clear understanding of this area
SI137O-00037-P50022 1 SI137O-00037 14.66 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> but books you read you can't get the point of the writer
SI137O-00037-P50023 1 SI137O-00037  0.00  9.74 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think that's very important because students can know how to learn from this learning facilities
SI137O-00037-P50023 1 SI137O-00037  9.74 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and teachers can get feedback very clearly from students from this learning facilities
SI137O-00064-P10006 1 SI137O-00064  0.00 16.38 <o,Q5,B1,P1> normally i used to go to the gym or church as well and spend some time with my family watching some movies walking around the beach for instance
SI137O-00064-P10006 1 SI137O-00064 16.38 18.00 <o,Q5,B1,P1> yeah

SI137O-00064-P30017 1 SI137O-00064 30.02 56.29 <o,Q5,C,P3> obviously they have some disadvantages because they will have not so much time maybe to have fun maybe sometimes to evaluate the right situations in school or maybe in the work because sometimes it's not possible deliver in the best way in both sides

SI137O-00064-P40018 1 SI137O-00064 13.94 26.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so we have some particles that fall as dust and can as well rain or snow and damage the environment

SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  5.20 <o,Q4,B2,P1> during my free time i love visiting museums
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100  5.20 13.56 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think that learning about art and our history can explain our current situation
SI137O-00100-P10006 1 SI137O-00100 13.56 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> and thanks to living in madrid i can go to several famous museums
SI137O-00100-P10007 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  8.43 <o,Q4,B2,P1> nowadays the best way for students to improve their english will be to use artificial intelligence
SI137O-00100-P10007 1 SI137O-00100  8.43 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> platforms such as this one can help students to improve the way that they speak write or his or her reading skills
SI137O-00100-P10008 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 15.58 <o,Q4,B2,P1> if i had the possibility to learn a new skill definitely it will be to learn a new language maybe a language that it seems difficult such as chinese or japanese
SI137O-00100-P10008 1 SI137O-00100 15.58 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P1> this kind of language will help us in the future
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 11.61 <o,Q5,C,P3> university students that do part time jobs are better in organising their schedules or their studying time
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100 11.61 29.57 <o,Q5,C,P3> but on the other hand it is difficult to them to focus on their exam so it would be kind of stressful during exam periods to work and study at the same time
SI137O-00100-P30017 1 SI137O-00100 29.57 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P3> but i will say that the optimal situation would be maybe to work in a part time job that is related with our or your area of studying such as for example if you are studying law it will be interesting to work with a lawyer that can helps you to understand better your knowledged about law
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  8.67 <o,Q5,C,P4> climate change is one of the biggest challenge that human being are facing nowadays
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100  8.67 19.35 <o,Q5,C,P4> mainly it is caused because of pollution pollution that factories emit or produce when they are working or functioning
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 19.35 27.54 <o,Q5,C,P4> this pollution contains some acid particles that are both in the wind or in the clouds
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 27.54 47.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> it is important to be aware that this kind of acid particles arrive into our lakes or rivers damaging its species that live there such as octopus or maybe different kind of fishes
SI137O-00100-P40018 1 SI137O-00100 47.13 59.87 <o,Q5,C,P4> but on the other hand due to the acid rains which is in the clouds it can reach into forests damaging our trees
SI137O-00100-P50019 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> my best piece of advice in terms of eating a healthy diet will be to introduce in this diet different types of food such as vegetables cereals fresh meat
SI137O-00100-P50020 1 SI137O-00100  0.00 15.93 <o,Q5,C,P5> drinking water is an habit that really helps your body to maintain the energy that it needs to face the complete routine as a day

SI137O-00100-P50021 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  9.26 <o,Q5,C,P5> i will said that it depends on the person and lifestyle of that person
SI137O-00100-P50021 1 SI137O-00100  9.26 13.68 <o,Q5,C,P5> if you love doing exercise why not doing every day

SI137O-00100-P50022 1 SI137O-00100  0.00  7.47 <o,Q5,C,P5> the healthiest option is to exactly sleep eight hours per day
SI137O-00100-P50022 1 SI137O-00100  7.47 19.94 <o,Q5,C,P5> but there are some studies that shows that sleeping just six or seven hours per day helps as well

SI137O-00100-P50023 1 SI137O-00100  3.36 17.31 <o,Q5,C,P5> i think that thanks to technology we are allowed to do several activities such as for example work from home or taking some pictures about our daily life

SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102  0.00  6.12 <o,Q5,B1,P3> all students should get job to pay for their university studies
SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102  6.12 17.01 <o,Q5,B1,P3> i think the principal advantage of this is related to the students can get some laboral experience
SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102 17.01 34.45 <o,Q5,B1,P3> but i think that principal disadvantage is related to the time because they'll lost time that they could use to improve in their studies
SI137O-00102-P30017 1 SI137O-00102 34.45 51.99 <o,Q5,B1,P3> my opinion is that there are more disadvantage than advantage for get a job being a university student

SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102 14.21 32.83 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then you need to get enter to the facility and after this you have to check in because if you don't you can fly anywhere
SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102 32.83 41.64 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after that you will need to pass to the document control security
SI137O-00102-P40018 1 SI137O-00102 41.64 51.02 <o,Q4,B1,P4> after wait for a hours or maybe a minutes you will be able to aboard the plane

SI137O-00102-P50019 1 SI137O-00102  0.00 15.38 <o,Q5,B1,P5> the students can use the technology searching advances information for example topics related to university career
SI137O-00102-P50019 1 SI137O-00102 15.38 19.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> and this is the way that they can use it
SI137O-00102-P50020 1 SI137O-00102  0.00 19.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think if you can get a classes face to face you should get that because classes online also it's good but i think face to face is better
SI137O-00102-P50021 1 SI137O-00102  0.00 19.86 <o,Q5,B1,P5> i think the principal skills that we can develop working together in group projects is the effective communication because in this case we will need to solve several problems

SI137O-00120-P30017 1 SI137O-00120 50.64 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and i agree it should be one priority of the schools and colleges
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120  0.00  6.79 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so today i will talk about how honey is produced
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120  6.79 11.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> first of all bees collect nectar from flowers

SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 24.10 36.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then beekeepers collect honey from beehives and put them into pots that are ready to be sell
SI137O-00120-P40018 1 SI137O-00120 36.27 46.56 <o,Q4,B2,P4> then these pots goes to the transportation that takes it to the supermarket when people can buy it
SI137O-00120-P50019 1 SI137O-00120  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they should consider how safe the country is if the country gives resources to students from abroad and how immersed in their culture the student will be and how much he will learn
SI137O-00120-P50020 1 SI137O-00120  0.00 11.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the advantages of studying in a second language is that you can get immersed in the culture and lifestyle
SI137O-00120-P50020 1 SI137O-00120 11.57 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> you can learn new things develop new skills and be able to communicate with more people

SI137O-00120-P50023 1 SI137O-00120  0.00 16.57 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i agree because everything depends on them what they eat how they eat when they are going to eat what they are going to do to deal with finances

SI137O-00124-P10006 1 SI137O-00124  0.00 10.56 <o,Q4,B1,P1> i like to listen to music and i enjoy to play guitar and to learn other musical instruments
SI137O-00124-P10007 1 SI137O-00124  0.00 10.39 <o,Q4,B1,P1> for me the best way to improve my english is to speak a lot with other people to travel abroad and even better to live abroad
SI137O-00124-P10008 1 SI137O-00124  0.00  4.49 <o,Q4,B1,P1> well i would like to learn to play sitar

SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124  9.55 24.38 <o,Q4,B1,P3> well with it you have some advantages for example they will not worry about how they will pay for the university which is a good thing
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 24.38 37.76 <o,Q4,B1,P3> but in the other side there are some disadvantages for it because they would not be able to concentrate in they studies
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 37.76 45.20 <o,Q4,B1,P3> they would not have enough time to learning the disciplines
SI137O-00124-P30017 1 SI137O-00124 45.20 58.68 <o,Q4,B1,P3> so in my opinion they students shouldn't have to work to pay for the graduation in a college
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124  0.00 10.61 <o,Q4,B1,P4> well we can see in this picture how the acid rain is produced

SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 20.02 27.77 <o,Q4,B1,P4> these acid particles are in the smoke that go up in the sky
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 27.77 33.25 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and these particles are carried by the wind
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 33.25 42.17 <o,Q4,B1,P4> some of the acid particles fall as dust and other particles mix with the cloud water
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 42.17 51.06 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and then finally these acid particles follow with the rain or the snow
SI137O-00124-P40018 1 SI137O-00124 51.06 60.04 <o,Q4,B1,P4> so we can see in this diagram how the acid rain is produced and returned through the soil
SI137O-00124-P50019 1 SI137O-00124  0.00  4.13 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well the best advice is to choose the right foods

SI137O-00124-P50021 1 SI137O-00124 12.21 19.77 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it's very important to exercise in different ways to improve your health
SI137O-00124-P50022 1 SI137O-00124  0.00  8.20 <o,Q4,B2,P5> well i agree that most of people need about eight hours per day

SI137O-00129-P10008 1 SI137O-00129  0.00 11.92 <o,Q4,B1,P1> if i could learn a new skill it would be speaking english better or speaking other languages like french and german
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129  0.00  8.58 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think all university students should do part time jobs while they are studying
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129  8.58 17.39 <o,Q4,B2,P3> i think there are some advantages for them to earn some money while they are at university
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 17.39 38.13 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and as the disadvantages i can say that while working or while doing part time jobs they cannot find perhaps enough time to study their own lessons
SI137O-00129-P30017 1 SI137O-00129 38.13 44.27 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so they maybe fail in their studies or in their exam

SI137O-00129-P40018 1 SI137O-00129 38.10 41.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> so they damage to environment

SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231  0.00 10.79 <o,Q4,C,P3> there's no getting away from the fact that more and more students are willing to take a part time job while they studying at universities
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 10.79 15.25 <o,Q4,C,P3> so this kind of phenomenon do have some advantages
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 15.25 31.40 <o,Q4,C,P3> students seize opportunities to earn incomes and they got a salary for their works which helps their parents save a lot of money and should be encouraged
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 31.40 46.58 <o,Q4,C,P3> but yet it has some disadvantages like part time job may distract students from their normal studying process and do some harm to their academic scores
SI137O-00231-P30017 1 SI137O-00231 46.58 59.87 <o,Q4,C,P3> so my opinion is that we should balance our work and study in order to develop ourselves while having access to the society

SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 30.10 33.29 <o,Q4,C,P4> then you went a document control
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 33.29 40.17 <o,Q4,C,P4> some officials will do some checks in order to ensure security
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 40.17 46.94 <o,Q4,C,P4> finally after you have passed the check you can enter the waiting room
SI137O-00231-P40018 1 SI137O-00231 46.94 56.08 <o,Q4,C,P4> during the waiting time you can choose to go shopping or having a coffee or eat something if you feeling peckish

SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  8.62 <o,Q5,C,P3> there are advantages if university students do part time job
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244  8.62 18.50 <o,Q5,C,P3> for example students can gain skills and working experience and they can earn some pocket money
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 18.50 27.78 <o,Q5,C,P3> if they want to buy things like cell phone they can pay it themselves
SI137O-00244-P30017 1 SI137O-00244 27.78 33.21 <o,Q5,C,P3> and through the working experience they can be independent

SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 50.69 54.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> that brings to the end of my presentation
SI137O-00244-P40018 1 SI137O-00244 54.43 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P4> thank you for your listening
SI137O-00244-P50019 1 SI137O-00244  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i would suggest that they should have three regular meal every day and they should eat vegetables and fruit as much as possible so that they can get enough vitamin
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  4.29 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it's important to drink a lot of water
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244  4.29 10.52 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you don't drink enough it's easier to get dehydrated
SI137O-00244-P50020 1 SI137O-00244 10.52 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if the body doesn't have enough water you will feel very tired and you have no energy to do anything
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  4.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> basically it's essential to do exercise every day
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244  4.94 12.04 <o,Q5,B2,P5> we don't need to do very much even twenty minutes that would be ok
SI137O-00244-P50021 1 SI137O-00244 12.04 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the most important thing is we keep moving and we live well
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  0.00  3.73 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think it depends on people
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  3.73  6.12 <o,Q5,B2,P5> some people need eight hours
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  6.12  9.01 <o,Q5,B2,P5> some people need only five hours
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244  9.01 13.46 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so the most important thing is you sleep enough
SI137O-00244-P50022 1 SI137O-00244 13.46 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if you sleep enough then you have energy to do anything
SI137O-00244-P50023 1 SI137O-00244  0.00 15.03 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i think technology has a negative impact on people's health because we always overuse the computer or smartphone
SI137O-00244-P50023 1 SI137O-00244 15.03 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it can harm our eyes our sight
SI137O-00251-P10005 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  9.12 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i'm very interested about learning other countries because it can get me an opportunity to study other traditions and cultures

SI137O-00251-P10006 1 SI137O-00251  5.07 19.86 <o,Q5,B2,P1> we can play all kinds of sports out there such as ping pong racing and basketball which will make us a healthier body and a fun time
SI137O-00251-P10007 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  8.06 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way for me to improve the english is to read aloud and watch some english movies
SI137O-00251-P10007 1 SI137O-00251  8.06 12.69 <o,Q4,B2,P1> read aloud will lead me to have a good pronunciations

SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251  0.00  9.46 <o,Q5,B2,P3> it is very common that all university students should do part time jobs while they're studying and there are many advantages
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251  9.46 15.72 <o,Q5,B2,P3> for example they can making friends when they are working with each others
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 15.72 23.49 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and they can also learn many practical skills which might be used in the near future
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 23.49 36.43 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and as for the disadvantages i think they will find it hard to strike a balance between their part time jobs and their studies
SI137O-00251-P30017 1 SI137O-00251 36.43 43.19 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion i think all university students should do the part time jobs

SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251  1.60  5.27 <o,Q4,B2,P4> i am giving a presentation about acid rain
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251  5.27 11.77 <o,Q4,B2,P4> firstly there are many cars and factories generate some pollutions like smoke
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 11.77 15.84 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and the acid particles are in the smoke
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 15.84 23.14 <o,Q4,B2,P4> as the smoke carried by the wind the acid particles will divided into two parts
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 23.14 30.20 <o,Q4,B2,P4> some acid particles will fall as dust and damage to the lake
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 30.20 38.80 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and other acid particles will mix with cloud waters and then they will contain in the rain or snows
SI137O-00251-P40018 1 SI137O-00251 38.80 42.43 <o,Q4,B2,P4> and that would do a great damage to the environment

SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 35.24 41.00 <o,Q5,B2,P4> they might check your personal belongings and your pocket and so on
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 41.00 51.77 <o,Q5,B2,P4> done with all those things you might need wait in your correct gate and sit or go to the toilet or shopping
SI137O-00319-P40018 1 SI137O-00319 51.77 59.87 <o,Q5,B2,P4> finally you might go on board and fly take off
SI137O-00319-P50019 1 SI137O-00319  0.00  6.53 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for the university student they might use google scholar to do their literature review
SI137O-00319-P50019 1 SI137O-00319  6.53 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> besides that they mind use zooms or teams to consult some questions with their professors and also make effective conversation with their classmate
SI137O-00319-P50020 1 SI137O-00319  0.00 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> it is apparently for the normal students face to face of course guide them to be discipline and also to be effective but for the student who are genius study alone is a much better way for them
SI137O-00319-P50021 1 SI137O-00319  0.00  8.24 <o,Q5,B2,P5> well firstly they will learn how to negotiate and cooperate with other team members
SI137O-00319-P50021 1 SI137O-00319  8.24 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> in addition they might study how to manage their personality properly because there are many different views in the teams
SI137O-00319-P50023 1 SI137O-00319  0.00 15.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> i have to say it is hundred percent significant for university to do so because right now the artificial intelligence is very modern and popular among the students

SI137O-00324-P10005 1 SI137O-00324  8.64 18.92 <o,Q5,B2,P1> and i want to speak with them in this idiom because it's the most popular language in the world
SI137O-00324-P10006 1 SI137O-00324  0.00 15.49 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i used to go with my friends and family to concerts museums and maybe go to swim or a coffee shop just to talk and having some fun
SI137O-00324-P10006 1 SI137O-00324 15.49 19.77 <o,Q5,B2,P1> but most of the time i'm just in my house

SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324  0.00 16.30 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantages are that the students can learn more about their work but at the same time they can win or gain more money while they are studying
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324 16.30 38.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and the disadvantages are that they didn't have a lot of time to work and studying and they cannot balance their job and study and so they need free time to do a lot of things
SI137O-00324-P30017 1 SI137O-00324 38.34 59.70 <o,Q5,B2,P3> and in my opinion they need to work and organisate their times to work and study at the same time without any problems and they can learn and improve their job and study time

SI137O-00388-P10006 1 SI137O-00388  0.00 11.08 <o,Q4,B2,P1> in my free time i really enjoy reading textbooks about philosophy and about sciences like physics

SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 15.70 22.91 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and in this way they don't have to depend on their parents
SI137O-00388-P30017 1 SI137O-00388 22.91 35.50 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantage i think that is the less time that they have to rest and to hang out with friends or something like that

SI137O-00414-P30017 1 SI137O-00414  0.00  7.65 <o,Q5,B2,P3> actually this is a complicated topic because of course you can find advantages and disadvantages
SI137O-00414-P30017 1 SI137O-00414  7.65 29.34 <o,Q5,B2,P3> the advantage is that the student can get some experience in the time that he's studying but the disadvantage in my point of view it's that maybe this person can lose the focus on the studies so this could be complicated

SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414  0.00 17.40 <o,Q5,B2,P4> i do not have a huge experience regarding acid rain however from what i can see on the picture i can understand that the pollution came from the vehicles and the factories
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 17.40 23.99 <o,Q5,B2,P4> it goes up in the air and it could be carried from the wind
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 23.99 44.72 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so part of these particles will fall as a dust directed in the environment nearby and part of these can be mixed with the cloud waters and then it's the way where the acid rain it's formed
SI137O-00414-P40018 1 SI137O-00414 44.72 54.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so this could be damage the environment a little bit far than when it's carried just as a dust
SI137O-00414-P50019 1 SI137O-00414  0.00 18.24 <o,Q4,B2,P5> the advice that i can give the people who wants to have better eating habits is that they should increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that they are eating and reduce the amount of sugar

SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 17.04 28.07 <o,Q4,B2,P3> that is important because you know that students most of the time are running out of money and they need to buy their own clothes or maybe things that they need
SI137O-00492-P30017 1 SI137O-00492 28.07 47.65 <o,Q4,B2,P3> the disadvantages is that they are worrying about many things like working produce money doing many things and not investing time and preparing theirselves to maybe get that degree or something related to that

SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 28.91 37.80 <o,Q4,B1,P4> some of this fall as a dust and others mix with a water in the cloud water for example
SI137O-00492-P40018 1 SI137O-00492 37.80 48.38 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and the situation of this is this acid rain move over the world and the atmosphere that it moves with the wind for example

SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 25.21 30.98 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the disadvantages are obviously too
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 30.98 38.75 <o,Q4,B2,P3> first some students may not fit for their fitness classes because they have a weak body
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 38.75 46.44 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and then they will get hurt in the fitness classes
SI137O-00608-P30017 1 SI137O-00608 46.44 59.70 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so in my opinion i recommend the fitness classes in the colleges because nowadays the students need to get more and more exercise in their school
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608  0.00  5.24 <o,Q4,B1,P4> today i'm going to talk about how honey is produced
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608  5.24  9.87 <o,Q4,B1,P4> first of all the bees will collect nectar from flowers
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608  9.87 16.28 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then in the beehives the bees make honey from nectar together
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 16.28 23.92 <o,Q4,B1,P4> when the honey is formed the beekeepers will collect honey from beehives
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 23.92 32.71 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then the beekeepers will pour the honey into bottles
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 32.71 47.79 <o,Q4,B1,P4> then after that there are some vehicles transform the bottoms of honey to the shops
SI137O-00608-P40018 1 SI137O-00608 47.79 59.36 <o,Q4,B1,P4> finally on the shops will give the price and put them into the case so we can buy them
SI137O-00608-P50019 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.26 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion they should consider about the fees when studying abroad and the conception level because the money is the most important thing and the locals' different culture is important too
SI137O-00608-P50020 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think having a good command of second language will help you have a better communication with other people in their countries and when you in different countries you will speak easily to other people
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 12.82 <o,Q4,B1,P5> in my opinion i think the most difficult thing is the local language because it is not the mother language for most students studying abroad
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608 12.82 17.43 <o,Q4,B1,P5> and the second one is the local different culture
SI137O-00608-P50021 1 SI137O-00608 17.43 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> it's very different from us
SI137O-00608-P50022 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i think they can learn the local culture by reading some books which about local histories and they will also go to the internet and search some information about the history
SI137O-00608-P50023 1 SI137O-00608  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B1,P5> i agree with them because when you study abroad just yourself you will learn many life skills which can help you become more independent and you will not depend too much on your parents for money and something else

SI137O-00618-P10007 1 SI137O-00618  0.00  5.79 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i think the best way to learn english is by listening broadway musicals
SI137O-00618-P10007 1 SI137O-00618  5.79 18.96 <o,Q4,B2,P1> it is important to listen music but i think broadway musical can use difficult structure that you can emit or mimic them so you could improve it

SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 14.32 29.62 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so for example i think some areas of those advantages are you could talk better and you have confidence when you have a presentation

SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 39.75 44.82 <o,Q4,B2,P3> for other part some disadvantages is that you are more busy
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 44.82 53.02 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and you don't have time to spend with your free time or you can spend with social things
SI137O-00618-P30017 1 SI137O-00618 53.02 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but in my opinion i think that is important to have a balance your life

SI137O-00857-P50021 1 SI137O-00857 14.82 16.02 <o,Q5,B2,P5> yeah
SI137O-00857-P50022 1 SI137O-00857  0.00 13.86 <o,Q4,B2,P5> they can learn it when they're going outside with friends to like clubs or if they just visit museums or historical sites or just a simple and nice restaurant where they serve local food
SI137O-00857-P50022 1 SI137O-00857 13.86 18.07 <o,Q4,B2,P5> that's also a very great place where you can learn about the local culture
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857  0.00  7.41 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's true because it gives you the freedom of doing whatever you like
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857  7.41 12.78 <o,Q4,B2,P5> and if you make mistakes there isn't really somebody from your family that could help you
SI137O-00857-P50023 1 SI137O-00857 12.78 19.09 <o,Q4,B2,P5> so it just makes you grow up as a person even if you don't want to

SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859  0.00  6.18 <o,Q4,B1,P4> at first the factories produces more pollution
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859  6.18 12.93 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and this cause acid particles are in smoke
SI137O-00859-P40018 1 SI137O-00859 12.93 19.51 <o,Q4,B1,P4> and this acid particles are carried by wind

SI137O-00898-P40018 1 SI137O-00898 16.74 22.92 <o,Q5,B2,P4> so they create smoke and this acid particles are inside this smoke

SI137O-00904-P30017 1 SI137O-00904 40.77 48.56 <o,Q5,C,P3> first of all the students will not have enough time for their study and for their leisure time

SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916  6.94  9.73 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it has both pros and cons
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916  9.73 32.04 <o,Q4,B2,P3> on the one hand the advantages could be that the students of schools and colleges should get or keep fit because of the fact that some scientific studies say that we must obtain some proteins or nutrients for our brain because our brains is working during the day
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 32.04 42.06 <o,Q4,B2,P3> and we need this substances to make a good connection between the brain and our body
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 42.06 52.56 <o,Q4,B2,P3> oh and on the other hand the disadvantages could be that the students have less time to study their units
SI137O-00916-P30017 1 SI137O-00916 52.56 59.87 <o,Q4,B2,P3> so to sum up in my opinion it's important to have time for all these type of activities
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916  0.00  5.58 <o,Q5,C,P4> if you want to know how honey comes from flower and go to the shop i'm going to explain it
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916  5.58  9.15 <o,Q5,C,P4> first of all bees collect nectar from flowers
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916  9.15 12.13 <o,Q5,C,P4> and bees make honey from nectar in beehives
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 12.13 21.55 <o,Q5,C,P4> so this type of animal is said to be the most important animal in the planet because without them the planet could die
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 21.55 33.75 <o,Q5,C,P4> secondly the beekeepers collected the honey from beehives in order to taking to a recipient that is called jars
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 33.75 50.02 <o,Q5,C,P4> by the end of the process they will have taken into a car where a person transport these type of recipient to a supermarket a shop
SI137O-00916-P40018 1 SI137O-00916 50.02 59.02 <o,Q5,C,P4> and there the people could buy this honey and take this food to their homes
SI137O-00916-P50019 1 SI137O-00916  0.00 14.61 <o,Q5,B2,P5> if i were them i would choose a country where i could speak the language for example u s a or london something like that because i could communicate with other people and it's easier to me
SI137O-00916-P50019 1 SI137O-00916 14.61 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> and other country where the meteorology is similar like the country where they came from
SI137O-00916-P50020 1 SI137O-00916  0.00  7.88 <o,Q5,B2,P5> first of all the advantage of study a second language is that you can communicate with other people
SI137O-00916-P50020 1 SI137O-00916  7.88 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example you can travel to more countries because you know another language and you can understand what other persons say to you
SI137O-00916-P50021 1 SI137O-00916  0.00 14.84 <o,Q5,B2,P5> the difficulty of studying in another country from my point of view is that you don't have your family near so if you want them near or you need them you only could call them with your mobile phone or something like that

SI137O-00916-P50022 1 SI137O-00916  8.94 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> for example in order to know this type of culture you could visit monuments or church or festivities
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916  0.00  7.25 <o,Q5,B2,P5> because of the fact that you are outside from my point of view you become more independent because you have to do all by yourself
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916  7.25 15.72 <o,Q5,B2,P5> you don't have your family near your friends near so if you want something you have to obtain it alone
SI137O-00916-P50023 1 SI137O-00916 15.72 19.94 <o,Q5,B2,P5> so this is the reason why you become more independent
SI137O-00922-P10006 1 SI137O-00922  0.00 10.78 <o,Q4,B2,P1> i'm inclined to reading novels which can allow me step into the fantastic world that the books provides

SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 10.55 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it's argued by many people that all students should get occupations to pay for their university studies on their own
SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931 10.55 28.72 <o,Q4,B2,P3> it has several advantages main of them is that they get the experience of working in a workplace and they have extra pocket money and they do not need to ask money for their parents
SI137O-00931-P30017 1 SI137O-00931 28.72 52.19 <o,Q4,B2,P3> but the jobs in their free time may not leave enough time for their university studies which is why i think it's better for them to get jobs after finishing their degree

SI137O-00931-P50020 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 19.94 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i also think that face to face learning is the best way of studying because the students who are face to face studying will be under supervision because not every student are able to study without supervision
SI137O-00931-P50022 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 14.82 <o,Q4,B2,P5> no i don't think so because attending lectures have always seemed boring to students so i think reading alone can be much more effective way of studying
SI137O-00931-P50023 1 SI137O-00931  0.00 17.55 <o,Q4,B2,P5> i think it's really important for universities to provide their students with modern learning facilities because if they are not up to date it can have bad impact on their students' productivity

SI137O-00976-P10008 1 SI137O-00976  0.00 11.36 <o,Q5,B2,P1> i suppose it might be to learn how to play the piano coz i've already know how to play the violin and i really love music

SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 11.44 18.30 <o,Q5,C,P3> and you know the university students they are nearly to be a society member
SI137O-00976-P30017 1 SI137O-00976 18.30 25.75 <o,Q5,C,P3> and that will give them some money and give them more ways to get the money to pay for their life
