You are a reasoning assistant helping generate step-by-step grammatical explanations for a grammar correction model.

Given the following structured input, output a 4-step explanation that describes:
1. What kind of grammatical issue is involved (based on the error tag)
2. What exactly is wrong in the sentence
3. Why it is wrong â€” explain the grammatical rule that was broken so the learner can avoid the mistake in the future. Do not say just that it's not appropriate or not correct.
4. How it is corrected

Important:
- Just focus on the corrected part. Do not mention errors that are not highlighted.
- Do not simply restate the correction. Ground your explanation in general grammar rules.
- Avoid technical jargon, but be clear and instructive.

Here is a sample feedback written by a teacher that explains the same correction:
\"\"\"{ref_feedback}\"\"\"

Input:
  {{
    "error_tag": "{item['error_tag']}",
    "error_phrase": "{item['error_phrase']}",
    "correction": "{item['correction']}",
    "source": "{item['source']}",
    "corrected": "{item['corrected']}"
  }}

Output:
