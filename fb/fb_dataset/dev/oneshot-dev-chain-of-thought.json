    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue involved here is the incorrect usage of the word \"no\" in the context of the sentence, tagged as \"R:OTHER\".\n\n2. The error in the sentence is the phrase \"no many students\". The word \"no\" is used incorrectly before the quantifier \"many\".\n\n3. The reason this is wrong is because in English, the word \"no\" is used to completely negate a noun, as in \"no students passed\". However, when we want to express partial negation or emphasis before quantifiers like \"many\", we use \"not\" instead of \"no\". \n\n4. Therefore, the correct phrase should be \"not many students\". The corrected sentence reads, \"...working and studying is the ideal way, but not many students can accomplish it.\" This correctly conveys the intended meaning, which is that only a few students can manage to work and study at the same time."

While \"would\" can be used to describe repeated actions in the past, it is not typically used to describe a continuous state or condition in the past. In this case, the sentence is referring to a past state of not having much work or studying to do. Therefore, the simple past tense \"did\" is more appropriate to use.\n4. The sentence is corrected by replacing \"would\" with \"did\". The corrected sentence is: \"When I was a child, I didn't have much work or studying I needed to do. I just needed to have fun.\""

The form \"haves\" is not a standard verb form in English and is not used. The rule broken here is that the verb must agree with its subject in number. In other words, a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb.\n4. The correction is to replace \"haves\" with \"have\". So, the corrected phrase is \"problems which have solutions\"."

The exact problem in the sentence is the omission of the preposition \"in\" before the phrase \"my vocabulary\".\n\n3. This is incorrect because in English, we use the preposition \"in\" to denote that something is contained or included within something else. In this context, \"in my vocabulary\" suggests that your vocabulary is a part of your language skills that you're enhancing. Omitting the preposition \"in\" breaks this grammatical rule and makes the sentence difficult to understand.\n\n4. The sentence is corrected by adding the preposition \"in\" before \"my vocabulary\".

The problem in the sentence is the absence of \"the\" before \"most similar\" in the phrase \"my son is most similar to me\". \n3. The reason this is incorrect is because when we are comparing one thing to all others within a certain group, we use \"the\" before \"most\". This definite article is used to indicate that out of all possible comparisons, the one specified is the greatest or most significant. Without \"the\", the sentence lacks clarity and precision.\n4.

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue in this sentence is related to word order (indicated by the error tag \"R:WO\").\n2. The problem lies in the phrase \"together different things\". \n3. The phrase is incorrect because in English, adjectives (like 'different') typically come before the noun they modify ('things'), and adverbs (like 'together') usually follow the noun phrase they are associated with. This is a common rule for the order of adjectives and adverbs in English sentences.\n4. The correct phrase should be \"different things together\". The adjective 'different' modifies 'things', and the adverb 'together' follows the noun phrase 'different things'. So, the corrected sentence is: \"we enjoy doing different things together but one of the things that we probably do most is to go out for a beer and not a couple of beers just to have yeah interesting or normal conversation about some serious thing\"."

In English, modal verbs are followed by the infinitive of another verb without 'to'. Here, the verb \"helps\" is in the third person singular form, which is incorrect in this context.\n4. The correction is to replace \"helps\" with \"help\". So, the corrected phrase is \"can help you\", which follows the rule of using the base form of the verb after a modal verb."

The problem lies in the use of the word \"days\" in the phrases \"when it is sunny days\" and \"if it is rainy days\".\n3. This is incorrect because \"it is\" refers to a singular entity or a general condition, not multiple entities. Therefore, using \"days\" after \"it is sunny\" or \"it is rainy\" breaks the subject-verb agreement rule in English. The phrase should refer to the condition of the day in general, not to multiple days.\n4. The sentence is corrected by removing the word \"days\" from the phrases. So, \"when it is sunny days\" becomes \"when it is sunny\", and \"if it is rainy days\" becomes \"if it is rainy\"."

The corrected sentence reads: \"Drinking water is extremely important for human beings because we are made up of a high percentage of water.\""

The reason these phrases are wrong is because of a rule related to modal verbs. Modal verbs (like \"must\") are always followed directly by the base form of the verb, without the use of \"to\". This is a common mistake because with non-modal verbs (like \"want\" or \"need\"), we do use \"to\" before the verb (e.g., \"want to go\", \"need to see\").\n\n4. The corrected sentence removes the unnecessary \"to\" after \"must\". So, \"you must to be independent\" becomes \"you must be independent\", and \"you must to do all thing alone\" becomes \"you must do everything by yourself\"."

The error in the sentence is the use of the word \"out\" after \"find\". In this context, \"find out\" is not appropriate.\n\n3. The phrase \"find out\" is typically used when you are trying to discover facts or information, often followed by a clause, like 'find out what', 'find out who', etc. However, when you're referring to finding specific objects or solutions, like 'ways', the correct phrase to use is \"find\" without the \"out\".\n\n4. The correction involves removing the word \"out\" from \"find out\". So, the corrected sentence is: \"universities need to find ways to make it easier for students to learn or for students to want to learn for them to want to do that\"."

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue in this sentence is related to the error tag \"M:PART\", which stands for missing particle. A particle is a word that must be included in a phrase to make it grammatically correct and meaningful.\n\n2. The problem in the sentence is the omission of the word \"up\" in the phrase \"make my mind about where I want to live\".\n\n3. This is incorrect because in English, when we talk about deciding on something after considering it, we use the phrase \"make up my mind\". The word \"up\" is a necessary part of this phrase, and without it, the phrase is grammatically incorrect and may not convey the intended meaning.\n\n4. To correct this, we insert the word \"up\" into the phrase, making it \"make up my mind\". So, the corrected sentence is: \"at the moment I don't really know where I want to live in the future. I do know that I want to be able to travel and discover different countries to make up my mind about where I want to live when I'm an adult\"."

The error in the sentence is the use of the word \"informations\".\n3. The word \"information\" is an uncountable noun in English, meaning it does not have a plural form. The use of \"informations\" is incorrect because it attempts to pluralize an uncountable noun, which goes against the rules of English grammar.\n4. The correct way to phrase this is by using \"information\" instead of \"informations\". So, the corrected sentence becomes: \"by surfing some educational websites students can acquire a lot of useful educational information and it can help them enhance their educational skills and help them to get a high score\"."

The problem lies in the phrase \"pollution it 's going to the air\". Here, the contraction \"'s\" (it is) is used incorrectly right after the noun 'pollution'.\n3. This is incorrect because in English grammar, a contraction like 'it's' cannot directly follow a noun to describe it further. Instead, we use relative pronouns like 'which' or 'that' to introduce additional information about the noun. In this case, 'which is' should be used after 'pollution' to provide more details about it.\n4. The correct sentence should be \"pollution which is going to the air\". Here, 'which is' correctly links and describes 'pollution', making the sentence grammatically correct."

The problem lies in the use of the conjunction \"and\" in the phrase \"seven and eight hours\".\n3. The mistake here is using \"and\" when \"or\" should have been used. The conjunction \"and\" is used to connect items that are both true or happening at the same time. However, in this context, the speaker is referring to two possible amounts of sleep, not both at the same time. Therefore, the conjunction \"or\", which is used to connect alternatives or choices, should be used.\n4. The corrected sentence replaces \"and\" with \"or\", making the phrase \"seven or eight hours\". This correctly presents the two amounts of sleep as alternatives, not as something that occurs simultaneously. So, the corrected sentence is: \"I think that is true but sometimes it is difficult to sleep seven or eight hours at night but it is true\"."

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue in this sentence is categorized under the \"R:OTHER\" tag. This tag is used for a variety of errors that don't fit neatly into other categories. In this case, the error is related to the incorrect use of verb forms after 'to'.\n2. The problem in the sentence is the phrase \"students to being active\". The word \"being\" is used incorrectly in this context.\n3. The error occurs because the infinitive form of the verb is not used after 'to'. In English, when we use the structure 'for someone to [verb]', the word 'to' is part of the infinitive form and should be followed by the base form of the verb, not a gerund (-ing form). In this case, 'being' is a gerund and is incorrect.\n4. The corrected sentence replaces \"being\" with \"be\", resulting in the phrase \"help them be active\". This correction follows the rule mentioned above, using the base form of the verb 'be' after 'to'. This makes the sentence grammatically correct and more understandable."

The grammatical issue in this sentence is categorized under the \"U:OTHER\" error tag, which often refers to miscellaneous or less common errors that don't fit neatly into other categories. In this case, it pertains to the incorrect use of conjunctions between adjectives.\n\n2. The problem lies in the phrase \"little and annoying insects\". The conjunction \"and\" is used unnecessarily between the adjectives \"little\" and \"annoying\".\n\n3. The error is due to a misunderstanding of how to use multiple adjectives to describe a single noun in English. When we use more than one adjective before a noun, we usually don't need to use \"and\" between them unless they are of equal importance or cannot be logically separated. In this case, \"little\" and \"annoying\" are both describing the insects, but they don't need to be connected with \"and\".\n\n4. The corrected sentence removes the \"and\" between \"little\" and \"annoying\", resulting in \"those annoying little insects\". This makes the sentence flow better and adheres to the general rule for using multiple adjectives in English."
