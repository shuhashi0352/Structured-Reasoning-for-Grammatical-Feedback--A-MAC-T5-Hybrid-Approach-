The exact issue in the sentence is the phrase \"in rain in\". This phrase is not clear and doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.\n\n3. This phrase is wrong because it doesn't follow the rules of English syntax or word order. In English, prepositions like \"in\" are typically used to show location, time, or manner. However, in this case, \"in rain in\" doesn't provide a clear meaning or connection to the rest of the sentence. \n\n4. The correction for this error is to replace \"in rain in\" with \"transform into\". This change makes the sentence more coherent and clear. The corrected sentence now reads: \"...and the other acid particles mix with cloud water and transform into your rain and snow...\" This implies that the acid particles change, or transform, into rain and snow."

The specific error in the sentence is the use of the word \"carry\". In the context of this sentence, it should be \"are carried\".\n3. This error occurs because the sentence is describing an action (carrying) that is happening to the acid particles, not an action that the particles are doing themselves. In English, when the focus is on the action rather than who or what is performing the action, we use the passive voice. The passive voice is formed by using the verb \"to be\" in the correct tense, followed by the past participle of the main verb. In this case, \"are carried\" is the correct form.\n4. The sentence has been corrected by replacing \"carry\" with \"are carried\". Now, it accurately reflects that the acid particles are not carrying themselves, but are being carried by the wind. The corrected sentence reads: \"...the acid particles are in smoke and then they are carried in the air by wind...\"."

The verb \"spend\" should be followed by a gerund to describe how time is used. In this case, \"to listen\" should be in its gerund form, \"listening.\"\n4.

The word \"stay\" is in the present tense, which doesn't fit with the past hypothetical context.\n\n4. The correct way to express this would be \"if I 'd just stayed at home\".

The issue lies in the use of the verb \"show\" in the phrase \"that picture show us\".\n3. The error is due to the fact that the subject \"that picture\" is singular, and according to English grammar rules, a singular subject should be paired with a singular verb. In this case, the verb \"show\" is in its plural form, which is incorrect.\n4. The correct form of the verb to use with a singular subject is \"shows\". Therefore, the corrected phrase should read \"that picture shows us\"."

The reason this is incorrect is because \"and\" is used to connect similar or related ideas, while \"but\" is used to express contrast or opposition between two ideas. In this sentence, the second part presents a potential negative outcome that contrasts with the benefits mentioned in the first part. Therefore, \"but\" should be used to show this contrast.\n\n4.

The term \"independent economy\" is incorrect in this context because the word \"economy\" generally refers to a large-scale system of trade and industry, such as a country's economy, rather than an individual's financial situation. Therefore, it's not suitable to use \"economy\" to describe personal financial independence. \n\n4. The correct way to express this idea is to use the term \"financially independent\".

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue in this sentence is the incorrect use of a contraction, as indicated by the error tag \"U:CONTR\".\n2. The error in the sentence is the use of the contraction \"'re\" before the verb \"come\", resulting in \"they 're come\".\n3. This is incorrect because in English, we do not use contractions before verbs. Contractions like \"'re\" are used to shorten \"are\", and are typically used before adjectives, adverbs, or nouns, not before verbs.\n4. The correction involves removing the contraction \"'re\". So instead of \"they 're come\", the corrected sentence reads \"they come\". This makes the sentence grammatically correct and easier to understand."

The problem lies in the use of the word \"practice\" in the phrase \"and practice with other people in other countries.\"\n3. The error occurs because the verb \"practice\" is being used as a noun to refer to an activity. In English, when a verb functions as a noun, it should take the gerund form, which ends in '-ing.' Therefore, \"practice\" should be \"practicing.\"\n4. The corrected sentence should read: \"watching t v and movies and practicing with other people in other countries so when I have the opportunity to practice with other people for my job I take it.\""

The problem in the sentence is with the use of the verb \"do\" in the context of \"to do many sports and to do other workouts\".\n3. It is incorrect because when referring to ongoing activities like sports or workouts, the gerund form of the verb (verb+ing) is typically used in English, not the base form of the verb.\n4. The correction involves changing \"do\" to \"doing\" to correctly express the ongoing nature of the activities. Therefore, \"to do many sports and to do other workouts\" becomes \"on doing many sports and doing other workouts\"."

This is an incorrect order of words.\n3. The mistake here is the incorrect placement of cardinal (five) and ordinal (first) numbers. In English, when we use cardinal and ordinal numbers together, the ordinal number should come before the cardinal number. Saying \"five first\" breaks this rule.\n4. The correct phrase should be \"first five\". Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: \"we can see in the first five days the line shows an increase in the thousands of people who listen to tunes net\"."

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue in this sentence is related to the incorrect use of a noun, as indicated by the error tag \"R:NOUN\".\n2. The error in the sentence is the use of the word \"account\" in the phrase \"take into account\".\n3. The phrase \"take into account\" is often used without a direct object inserted between the verb \"take\" and the preposition \"into\". In this case, the direct object \"the environment\" is inserted, which makes the phrase grammatically incorrect. When we want to specify what is being considered, we should use the phrase \"take into consideration\" instead.\n4. The corrected sentence replaces \"account\" with \"consideration\", resulting in \"take the environment into consideration\". This adjustment makes the sentence grammatically correct and more natural sounding."

The specific error in the sentence is the absence of the word \"out\" in the phrase \"when you go\".\n\n3. This is incorrect because in English, when we talk about leaving a place or going somewhere, we often use the phrase \"go out\". Simply saying \"go\" can be ambiguous and might not clearly convey the intended meaning. \n\n4. The sentence is corrected by adding the word \"out\" after \"go\".

The problem in the sentence is in the phrase \"between thousand and one thousand twenty of people\". Here, the conjunction \"and\" is missing between \"thousand\" and \"twenty\".\n\n3. The reason this is incorrect is because in English, when expressing numbers over 100, we use the conjunction \"and\" to separate the hundreds place from the tens and ones places. Without this \"and\", the number can be confusing and unnatural to read or hear.\n\n4. The correct phrase should be \"between a thousand and one thousand and twenty people\". By adding the conjunction \"and\" between \"thousand\" and \"twenty\", the number is expressed correctly and naturally in English."

The error in this sentence is the phrase \"very related.\" The speaker is trying to express that they have common interests with their sister, but \"very related\" is not the correct way to phrase this.\n\n3. The phrase \"very related\" is incorrect because it doesn't accurately convey the intended meaning. In English, when we want to express that two or more people have the same interests, hobbies, or topics of conversation, we use the term \"shared.\" The term \"very related\" could be confusing because it's typically used to describe a close connection or similarity, not common interests.\n\n4. The correct way to express this idea is by using the term \"shared.\" The corrected sentence is: \"I suppose I am similar to my sister because she is near my age and we have some shared interests like we both enjoy playing games and computers.\" This clearly communicates that the speaker and their sister have common interests."
