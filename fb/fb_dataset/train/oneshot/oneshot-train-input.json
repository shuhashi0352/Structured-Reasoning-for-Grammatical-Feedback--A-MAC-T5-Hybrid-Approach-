The problem lies in the phrase \"found difficult to studying\". The preposition \"to\" is used incorrectly before the gerund \"studying\".\n3.

The use of \"to\" before a gerund can lead to confusion and disrupt the flow of the sentence.\n4. The correction involves removing the unnecessary \"to\" before \"studying\".
