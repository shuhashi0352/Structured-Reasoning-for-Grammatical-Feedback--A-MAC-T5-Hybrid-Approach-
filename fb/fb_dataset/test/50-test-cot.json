    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue in this sentence is related to the incorrect use of a preposition, as indicated by the error tag \"R:PREP\".\n2. The specific error in the sentence is the use of the preposition \"of\" in the phrase \"your learning of the university\".\n3. The reason this is incorrect is because the preposition \"of\" is not used to indicate the location or place where learning or studying is happening. Instead, the preposition \"at\" is typically used to denote the location of such actions. \n4. Therefore, the correction involves replacing \"of\" with \"at\" in the phrase, making it \"your learning at the university\". This change correctly indicates that the learning is taking place at the university."

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue involved here is tagged as \"M:OTHER\", which typically refers to miscellaneous errors that don't fit into other specific categories. In this case, the issue is with the structure and flow of the sentence.\n\n2. The problem with the original sentence is that it's repetitive and disjointed. The sentence \"I really like spending time with my great grandmother I really love her I think it's one of the most valuable persons in my life\" is a run-on sentence with multiple ideas crammed together without clear connections.\n\n3. The reason this is wrong is that it makes the sentence hard to follow and understand. In English, it's important to clearly connect related ideas and avoid unnecessary repetition. This helps make your statement more coherent and easy to understand. Run-on sentences, like the one in the original text, break this rule by cramming multiple ideas together without clear connections or transitions.\n\n4. The sentence is corrected by restructuring it to connect the ideas more clearly and eliminate unnecessary repetition. The corrected sentence is \"I really love her I think she's one of the most important people in my life she's taught me so much and I really enjoy spending time with her\". This sentence connects the ideas more smoothly, making it easier to understand and more natural to read."

The issue lies in the phrase \"where make honey.\" It is unclear who or what is performing the action of making honey.\n3. The error is due to the omission of a subject pronoun in the clause. In English, every sentence or clause needs a subject, which is the person or thing performing the action. In the phrase \"where make honey,\" the action is \"make honey,\" but the subject who is doing this action is missing. This makes the sentence incomplete and grammatically incorrect.\n4.

This error occurs because the sentence is describing an action (carrying) that is happening to the acid particles, not an action that the particles are doing themselves. In English, when the focus is on the action rather than who or what is performing the action, we use the passive voice. The passive voice is formed by using the verb \"to be\" in the correct tense, followed by the past participle of the main verb. In this case, \"are carried\" is the correct form.\n4.

In this case, \"talkative\" does not accurately or appropriately modify \"skills\".\n4. The sentence is corrected by removing the inappropriate adjective \"talkative\".

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue involved here is related to the verb form (tagged as \"U:VERB:FORM\").\n2. The problem lies in the phrase \"to do many sports and to do other workouts\". The infinitive form \"to do\" is incorrectly used after the phrase \"focus on that age\".\n3. This is incorrect because in English, when a verb follows a preposition like \"on,\" it should be in the gerund form (verb+ing). Also, \"focus on\" should be followed by an action, not a time expression. Therefore, \"to do\" should be changed to \"doing,\" and the focus should be on the activity, not the time expression.\n4. The corrected sentence changes \"to do many sports and to do other workouts\" to \"on doing many sports and doing workouts\", which is grammatically correct and clearer in meaning."

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue in this sentence is related to the use of contractions, specifically the contraction \"'d\" which can stand for \"had\" or \"would\". This is indicated by the error tag \"R:CONTR\".\n\n2. In the sentence, the error lies in the phrase \"if I stay just at home\". The word \"stay\" is incorrect in this context.\n\n3. The mistake here is that the sentence is discussing a hypothetical situation in the past. In English, when we talk about hypothetical situations that didn't happen in the past, we use \"had\" followed by a past participle. The word \"stay\" is in the present tense, which doesn't fit with the past hypothetical context.\n\n4. The correct way to express this would be \"if I 'd just stayed at home\". Here, \"'d\" is a contraction of \"had\", and \"stayed\" is the past participle of \"stay\". So, the corrected sentence reads: \"so generally it is i am a student abroad and i have to say that i 'm more independent and i 've learnt a lot of things that i could n't have learnt if i 'd just stayed at home so i totally agree\"."

The error in the sentence is the use of \"to\" after \"must\" in the phrase \"we must to travel.\"\n3. The reason this is incorrect is because after modal verbs such as \"must,\" \"can,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" and others, we directly use the base form of the verb without \"to.\" This is a standard rule in English grammar. In this case, \"must\" is a modal verb, and the verb following it (\"travel\") should be in its base form without \"to.\"\n4. The correction of this error involves removing the \"to\" after \"must.\" So, the corrected phrase becomes \"we must travel.\""

The mistake in the sentence is the use of the conjunction \"and\" where \"but\" should have been used.\n\n3. The reason this is incorrect is because \"and\" is used to connect similar or related ideas, while \"but\" is used to express contrast or opposition between two ideas. In this sentence, the second part presents a potential negative outcome that contrasts with the benefits mentioned in the first part. Therefore, \"but\" should be used to show this contrast.\n\n4. The sentence is corrected by replacing \"and\" with \"but\". The corrected sentence now correctly contrasts the benefits of working with the potential negative impact on grades."

    "feedback": "1. The grammatical issue present in this sentence is related to the use of possessive nouns, as indicated by the error tag \"M:NOUN:POSS\".\n\n2. The error lies in the phrase \"master onlines\". The word \"master\" should have a possessive marker \"'s\" to indicate that the online programs belong to the master's degree.\n\n3. This is incorrect because in English, when we want to show ownership or possession, we use the possessive form. This is usually done by adding an apostrophe and 's' to the end of the noun. In this case, the online programs belong to the master's degree, so we need to use the possessive form \"master's\".\n\n4. The corrected sentence therefore reads: \"I don't agree with this because for example there are a lot of degrees and master's online and in my opinion, I think that they are a good option to study\". The possessive marker \"'s\" has been added to \"master\" to correctly indicate that the online programs belong to the master's degree."

The specific error in the sentence is the absence of the word \"out\" in the phrase \"when you go\".\n\n3. This is incorrect because in English, when we talk about leaving a place or going somewhere, we often use the phrase \"go out\". Simply saying \"go\" can be ambiguous and might not clearly convey the intended meaning. \n\n4. The sentence is corrected by adding the word \"out\" after \"go\".

The problem in the sentence is the incorrect representation of the Latin phrase \"et cetera\". It is written as \"e t c\" in the sentence.\n\n3. This is incorrect because \"et cetera\" is a Latin phrase used in English to mean 'and so forth' or 'and other similar things'. It is usually abbreviated as 'etc.', not as 'e t c'. The words in the phrase should not be separated by spaces.\n\n4. The correction involves combining the separated letters 'e' and 't' to form the correct term 'et'.

In this case, the issue is related to the use of the mass noun 'advice'.\n\n2. The error in the sentence is the phrase \"one advice\". \n\n3. This is incorrect because 'advice' is a mass noun in English. Mass nouns, also known as uncountable nouns, cannot be counted directly. Therefore, we cannot say 'one advice'. Instead, when we want to refer to a single instance or example of something that is usually uncountable, we use the phrase 'piece of'. \n\n4. The correction is to replace \"one advice\" with \"one piece of advice\".

To correct this, we simply remove the words \"they are.\" The corrected sentence then reads: \"there are a few disadvantages as for instance they have less time for studying.\" This makes the sentence clearer and more concise."
